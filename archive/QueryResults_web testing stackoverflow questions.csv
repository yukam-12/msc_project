I can use selenium to start Firefox, login and trigger the PDF file download, and then (theoretically, I didn't try it) I can use a tool like <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">textract</a> to extract to text from the PDF file and inspect that it has the expected text and not an error message. </p>

<p>However the nature of my use case is that the file won't download at all if something is wrong and I'm rendering HTML onto a PDF using the python tool pdfkit:</p>

<pre><code>import pdfkit
to_pdf_file = '/tmp/output.pdf'
from bottle import static_file
css = '/srv/http/python.dev/python-common/assets/static_files/css/styles.css'
pdfkit.from_string(render_template(""oncall/dayview_reload"", values), to_pdf_file, css=css)
return static_file('output.pdf', root='/tmp', download='output.pdf')
</code></pre>

<p>So it feels rather pointless to test the PDF instead of testing the HTML because in practice I would only test that the third-party library pdfkit is working on, not testing my code. </p>

<p>I feel that I might as well test only the HTML that it renders and prints the correct result, or would it be important to actually test that the PDF is generated and prints the correct data?</p>

<p>Or should I use some other approach to make my test ""right"" ?</p>

<p>My test code looks like the following right now, it starts selenium and makes the download, but I feel that I might as well test only the HTML instead of the PDF. </p>

<pre><code>class ViewTest(unittest.TestCase):
@classmethod
def setUp(cls):
    cls.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

I have not used automated testing at all before, so am still getting to grips with it. </p>

<p>The framework that I have decided to use is <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org/#/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protractor</a>, and I'm just looking at starting to write some basic tests, however, I'm having a bit of trouble getting hold of some of the HTML elements from within the <code>spec.js</code> file where my tests will be written. I have the following <code>describe</code> block in <code>spec.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>describe('My App', function() {
    var loginForm = element(by.id('loginForm'));
    var loginBtn = element(by.className('form-control'));
    var usernameInputField = element(by.id('inputName'));
    var passwordInputField = element(by.id('inputPass'));

    it('should hit the VM hosted site', function() {
        browser.get('http://192.168.x.xyz:8080);
        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual('My app');
    });

    //Test to log in:
    it('should enter the username into the username field on log in form', function() {
        usernameInputField.sendKeys('username');
        passwordInputField.sendKeys('password');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>conf.js</code> file currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>exports.config = {
    framework: 'jasmine',
    seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
    specs: ['spec.js'],
    multiCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'firefox'
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the command <code>protractor conf.js</code> from the command line, I get some output that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, ""[id=""inputName""])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have 'inspected' the input field for the username on the form in the browser, and it shows that the HTML element's 'name' attribute is 'inputName'.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the console is giving me the error that says it's trying to find the element using a 'CSS selector'- I'm expecting it to try and find the element by it's HTML tag's 'name' attribute... Clearly I'm doing something wrong in how I'm writing the 'test to log in', because if I comment that out, and run <code>protractor conf.js</code> again, I get 0 failures- so the other test is running successfully...</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? How can I get the form input fields and enter correct log in details into them to check that the 'log in' feature works correctly?</p>

<p>As an aside, although I will want to test the 'log in' capability too, is there  a way to 'skip' this during testing, so that I can run the tests on all of the features of the app, without Protractor having to log in to the app every time to run the tests?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I've done what was suggested by @KatePaulk in their answer, and my test now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var usernameInputField = element(by.name('inputName'));
var passwordInputField = element(by.name('inputPass'));
...
function loginAsUser(username, password) {
    username = ""abc"";
    password = ""xyz"";
    usernameInputField.sendKeys(username);
    passwordInputField.sendKeys(password);

    loginBtn.click();
}

it('should log the user in to app', function() {
    loginAsUser(username, password);
});
</code></pre>

<p>and while the script is running, although the username &amp; password fields are correctly populated on the log in form, I get an error message when the script is trying to press the 'Log In' button, to submit the form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>W/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, .form-control) = the first result will be used</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I continue the script after this, the browser window is closed, and the script exits.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong with how I am retrieving &amp; clicking the 'log in' button?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>As requested, the HTML for the form is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""page-signin""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""signin-header""&gt;
    &lt;section class=""logo text-center""&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Login to {{main.brand}}&lt;/h1&gt;

So far, so good. The XML schema is simple and most of the data I need is there: HTML input field IDs and names, type of field, and the page of the application and the URL associated with that page.</p>

<p>The problem is, I also need to know what the full contents of the WebList (Combo Box) and WebRadioGroup <strong>values</strong> were at the time that the Shared Object Repository was created.</p>

<p>I realize that Combo Boxes in HTML forms have both a value displayed to the user, and a value submitted as part of the HTML form, and the two values are not necessarily equivalent. That is fine. What we need for testing is the value contained within the HTML form -- the value that's sent with an HTTP Request in the Body. The value that's displayed to the user in the GUI is not relevant to our needs.</p>

<p>Also, when there are multiple radio buttons in a group, HTML will encode the value with a developer-defined value depending on which button is selected. For example, they could assign value ""A"" to radio button 1, value ""B"" to radio button 2, and value ""C"" to radio button 3, and then if you try to get the value of the radio button group in the HTML, it will return the value of the button that has been clicked by the user.</p>

<p>I need to get those possible values into the Shared Object Repository, so that we can later process the Shared Object Repository's exported XML and re-use that data.</p>

<p>So my questions, which are closely related, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the Shared Object Repository native format contain this data at all? Is it supported?</li>
<li>Can the Shared Object Repository's XML-exported format contain this data? Will the format hold it?</li>
<li>Can any built-in or custom QTP scripts generate a Shared Object Repository containing this data automatically while recording a path through the application?</li>
</ul>

"6522","1","6524","","2013-07-31 12:51:00","","4","303","<p>I am working at a small in-house dev department in a non-IT organisation. Me and another junior dev are creating a mid-sized CRUD web application in ASP MVC. There is no formal test process in our department. I am trying to gently introduce some best practices including unit testing, of which I only have theoretical knowledge myself. </p>

<p>We started with creating a nice, clean database schema. During the requirements analysis and database modelling phases, I went through piles of real data from our domain and then entered them all per hand in the database. Then the other dev got the task of creating the Model part of the project, writing the entity and repository classes needed for Linq to SQL. </p>

<p>I outlined my vision for the unit tests of his classes: We already have a small but consistent set of data we can use as a test data. I suggested that he automatically recreate the database from scratch, filling the tables per SQL script, and then let the tests run against the dataset. He agreed and went to work. </p>

<p>Now, a few weeks later, he has for some reason decided that he doesn't like working with the data as it is. He initializes the database by re-creating the schema, and then fills it using our Linq classes and their connections. He does not pay attention to keeping the data in a state which is sensible for the domain. Example: in my data, a mouse could have a mutation expressed in the mammary glands. In his data, a drosophila can have a mutation expressed in the mamary glands, because he just set random connections between records from the proper tables, without caring for business meaning. </p>

<p>I see two problems with this approach. </p>

<ol>
<li>I think that the tests supposed to verify the work of our Linq classes should not use the Linq classes for initialization of the data set. From my point of view, this is a bad case of circular reasoning. </li>
<li>I would like to keep one set of test data which is applicable for most types of test, maybe with a few necessary variations. While there is no reason why the data used for unit testing the database connection should be the same as the data used for tests involving the users, there is also no reason to make it different. And the users cannot work with data which tells them that a drosophila has mammary glands. So, I would like us to adapt our tests to work with the old data set. </li>
</ol>

<p>My co-worker is unhappy, because my suggestions mean extra work load. He feels that they are completely unnecessary. </p>

<p>My questions for you: First, is his approach wrong (so we should change it), or is it right (maybe one of many possible right approaches)? Second, is my own suggestion right or wrong? Third, if his approach is so wrong we should change it, what arguments can I use to convince him? (He is absolutely no convinced by my ""circular reasoning"" argument). </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> User246 <a href=""https://sqa.stackexchange.com/users/246/user246"">answered</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course if you don't implicitly trust your Linq classes, you should test them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under which circumstances would I trust my Linq classes? Do I need to test them, or not? </p>

<p>He/she also said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One way to test the Linq classes would be to write the data using Linq and then read the data using some other means</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what I was planning to do. My question was: Why? Why cannot I test the Linq classes with themselves? I thought that it is so obviously a bad idea that it doesn't need an explanation. But now that my co-worker does not believe that it is a bad idea, I realised that I have no arguments against it. So, what are the arguments for this view?</p>

I just tried writing selenium python code which logs in to the website, waits till it redirects to target page and then tries to fetch certain information from that target page. I am facing several issues. For example I am <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56682149/timeout-exception-while-waiting-for-webpage-with-element-in-headless-chrome"">getting <code>TimeoutException</code> when using headless chrome</a> and I am <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56685757/unable-to-expand-selenium-webelement-object-access-its-properties-in-pycharm"">not able to access properties of selected element on the target page</a>. Also, I believe I might have to revise this function some times in future as the target website might change the UI/UX. So, I was thinking if I should use some tool which will allow me to use browser and capture my action as I do it and generate the script for my action, so that whenever the UI/UX of the target site changes, I will just have to redo action, recapture it in that tool and use the script generated. I just want to avoid time I am wasting in thinking and coding how I can imitate the actions myself. I have several such actions targetting different sites. So to reduce overall developement time I want to know if any such tool is there.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>I am using Selenium/Java to do some data integrity testing. The website being tested is used to create and manipulate batches. These batches have various properties such as name, ID number, different quantities, and ingredients. This data for each batch is supposed to change and be updated as you progress through the workflow of the website. The Selenium tests are supposed to simulate the workflow and track the batches to verify the data integrity of the website.</p>

<p><strong>Current design:</strong></p>

<p>I am using the Page Object Model to abstract the page classes from the test classes. In addition, I have a <code>Batch</code> class with all the properties and getters/setters for most properties. In all applicable page classes, I have a <code>scrapeBatch()</code> method which scrapes the batch information and returns a <code>new Batch()</code> object with those properties set. I then have an <code>equals(Batch)</code> method defined for the <code>Batch</code> object to verify that there are no discrepancies between two batches. The <code>scrapeBatch()</code> methods for the page classes right now use setters to assign the properties to a <code>new Batch()</code> object.

<p>I would like to not have to use all the getters and setters to make the code more concise and to reuse more code wherever possible. I have read that using interfaces is the way to go, but I am having difficulty understanding how to define those interfaces in the most logical way. Any suggestions for ways to refactor my code would be greatly appreciated. I would be able to expand more on this too, if that is needed.</p>

"39746","1","39764","","2019-06-27 15:11:37","","0","119","<p>Heavily simplified example that I'm trying to make language agnostic: I have an XmlView Object that has a constant property FACTORY_NAME labeled ""factory"" and a constant property VIEW_NAME labeled ""view"". There is also a twodimensional string array somewhere that contains the links between the numbers 1, 3, 4 5 and a localization variable for their string representation in English, German and French, which are in resource files somewhere.</p>

<p>I then have a REST API call on <code>/factory/{id:\\d+}</code> that returns <code>&lt;factory&gt;&lt;view&gt;%did:%sid&lt;/view&gt;&lt;/factory&gt;</code>, where factory is whatever FACTORY_NAME is, view is whatever VIEW_NAME is, %did is whatever number you entered as a path parameter and can be either, 1, 3, 4 or 5 as a number, and %sid is a localized representation of that number (so one, ein, un; three, drei, trois; four, vier, quatre; five, fünf, cinq). Note that the actual code is many times more complicated with hundreds of API endpoints that do far more complicated things, this is just an example.</p>

<p>In the above contrived example, there are essentially 3 things I want to test: </p>

<ol>
<li>That the <code>/factory/{id:\\d+}</code> endpoint exists;</li>
<li>That any id number I enter in the above endpoint is in the expected response value, and that it's in the allowed values for the id property;</li>
<li>That the response XML is what I expect it to be.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are other things to test, but these will do for this example.</p>

<p>Based on the above example, to what extent should this test use hardcoded values and/or iteration to test that this code returns the expected values?</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I write 4 separate assertions that a GET to the factory endpoint gives an expected value, with the contacted endpoint hardcoded and comparing the XML response to the string above, hardcoded in the test? This seems kinda brittle since any change will break my test and I'll have a lot of repeated code.</li>
<li>Should I write 4 separate assertions as above, again with the factory endpoint hardcoded, but then using Xpath to retrieve the variable part and then comparing this to a hardcoded value?</li>
<li>Should I write 4 separate assertions, but with everything that's possibly variable being retrieved from the rest of my codebase?</li>
<li>Should I iterate over my localized string array and do an assert for each item in the array?</li>
<li>Should I do something else?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure what to do. Using the existing variables removes a lot of manually changing my tests when I change something, but it also means that I'm just checking if my values are processed correctly by my code and not if the values themselves are correct. Are there any generally accepted best practices for this scenario?</p>

<p>I want to direct my testing efforts in such a way to for example, with some level of automated checking, have some logical validation between my gateway's way of consuming each of the external providers, in order to detect earlier the symptoms of issues where I have the implementation of the consumption of one provider sometimes breaking the consumption of another one. </p>

<p>The restraints of the problem are that I have zero control of the development process, that is itself somewhat chaotic, and I can hardly enforce or let alone promote, for example, proper unit checking of the implementations of the consumer, plus code quality standards, and overall API documentation.</p>

<p>I've thought about attacking this problem with some form of contract testing, where I define the model of external providers, taking into account their public apis and their documentation, and worry only about the implementation consumer-side part of testing.</p>

<p>The thing is, this sort of approach, from my understanding, seems to be ""not advised"" by people who work on contract testing libraries, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Not recommended) Testing providers where the consumer and provider teams do not have good communication channels. (Source <a href=""https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/what_is_pact_good_for#what-is-it-not-good-for"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/what_is_pact_good_for#what-is-it-not-good-for</a> )</p>

<p>Any ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'll give some more example details to help frame a possible problem scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have full access to the code that implements this consumer for all
the external APIs;</li>
<li>I have access to test environments of both my service and the external provider services;</li>
<li>I have the ability to raise my service on a local level, but not the external services themselves;</li>
<li>I have access to some documentation and postman collections of some of the external apis;</li>
<li>Implementation of the feature ""consuming external service A"", sometimes jams/breaks ""consumption of another service B"", or even
disrupts other unrelated parts of ""my gateway service"";</li>
<li>Implementation of ""my gateway service"" is bound to an edge case scenario: weak development process, tightly coupled and extensive
code, inexistent unit checks, low code quality checks, and overall
handicapped/rushed development and requirements gathering process.</li>

<p>There's a few methods under test that hit other methods under test, that may hit others, that I'm responsible for testing. For example, at the time of me writing this, I'm trying to test this method:</p>

<pre><code>//SendRequest This is used to contact the apiserver synchronously.
func (apiPath *APIPath) SendRequest(context interface{}, tokenHandler *apiToken.APITokenHandlerSt,
    header map[string]string,
    urlParams []string, urlQueries url.Values,
    jsonBody []byte) apiCore.CallResultSt {
    if apiToken := tokenHandler.GetToken(apiPath.AuthType, apiPath.Scope); apiToken != nil {
        return apiPath.APICoreHandler.SendRequest(
            context,
            apiToken.Token,
            apiPath.GetPath(urlParams, urlQueries), apiPath.Type,
            header, jsonBody)
    } else {
        errMsg, _ := json.Marshal(errors.InvalidAuthentication())
        return apiCore.CallResultSt{DetailObject: errMsg, IsSucceeded: false}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>where the receiver struct is defined to be </p>

<pre><code>//APIPath=======================
//Used for url construction
type APIPath struct {
    APICoreHandler *apiCore.APICoreSt
    // domain name of API
    DomainPath string
    ParentAPI  *APIPath
    Type       apiCore.APIType
    // subfunction name
    SubFunc          string
    KeyName          string
    AutoAddKeyToPath bool
    AuthType         oAuth2.OAuth2Type
    Scope            string
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that method has an external dependency. It is defined thus: </p>

<pre><code>//Establish the request to send to the server
func (a *APICoreSt) SendRequest(context interface{}, token string, apiURL string, callType APIType, header map[string]string, jsonBody []byte) CallResultSt {
    if header == nil {
        header = make(map[string]string)
    }
    if header[""Authorization""] == """" {
        header[""Authorization""] = ""Bearer "" + token
    }
    header[""Scope""] = GeneralScope
    header[""Content-Type""] = ""application/json; charset=UTF-8""
    return a.CallServer(context, callType, apiURL, header, jsonBody)
}
</code></pre>

<p>and that method ends up hitting this one: </p>

<pre><code>//CallServer Calls the server
//
// Parameters:
// - `context` : a context to pass to the server
// - `apiType` : the HTTP method (`GET`,`POST`,`PUT`,`DELETE`,...)

func (a *APICoreSt) CallServer(context interface{}, apiType APIType, apiURL string, header map[string]string, jsonBody []byte) CallResultSt {

    req, err = http.NewRequest(string(apiType), Url, bytes.NewBuffer(jsonBody))
    if err != nil {
        //Use a map instead of errorSt so that it doesn't create a heavy dependency.
        errorSt := map[string]string{

            ""Message"": ""The request failed to be created."",

    }

    res, err = hc.Do(req)
    if res != nil {
        resBody, err = ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
        res.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(resBody))
    }
    return CallResultSt{resBody, logger.Instance.CheckAndHandleErr(context, res)}

}
</code></pre>

<p>(The struct these two methods are on is omitted for brevity: there's only one field of that struct that it relies on.)</p>

<p>These type of situations keep popping up in the code under test, and yesterday, I confronted the boss about this, citing these dependencies, and the fact that there's no struct makes them literally impossible to test-double (fake,stub,mock). I was merely asking to refactor it so that it hits an interface method, declared in the same file as the dependency, which those struct methods would implement (implementing interfaces is implicit in Golang).  It turned into a bit of an argument, and he brought the talking point ""What do you do about third-party dependencies and built-in dependencies?"" I told him that there's usually a way to test-double those concerns out (fakes, mocks, stubs), but he wouldn't budge.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about this situation to convince him that this refactoring is indeed necessary, and failing that, what should I do about this situation?</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The method under test has other business dependencies, defined thus: </p>

<pre><code>// GetToken returns the token having the specified `tokenType` and `scope`
//
// Parameters:
// - `tokenType`
// - `scope`
//
// Returns:
// - pointer to Token having `tokenType`,`scope` or nil
func (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) GetToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) *APITokenSt {
    if ath == nil {
        return nil
    }
    if i := ath.FindToken(tokenType, scope); i == -1 {
        return nil
    } else {
        return &amp;ath.Tokens[i]
    }
}

// FindToken finds token with specified `scope` and `tokenType`
//
// Parameters:
// - `tokenType` :  the `OAuth2Type` of the token we want
// - `scope`: the scope of the token we want
//
// Returns:
// - the index of the token in ath.Tokens, or -1 if it cannot be found
func (ath *APITokenHandlerSt) FindToken(tokenType oAuth2.OAuth2Type, scope string) int {
    for i, t := range ath.Tokens {
        if t.TokenType == tokenType &amp;&amp;
            t.Scope == scope {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}

Once my current spec is done running I'm calling a page object function to delete all the components to clean up the workspace before moving on to the next spec. I'd say about 50% of the time I'm noticing a stale element reference error on the line with my <code>.filter()</code> function. I added some log statements to see if I could figure out what's happening and noticed some behavior I didn't understand. It seems like for every component in my list, the filter function is running four times. Anyone know if this is expected behavior? </p>

<p>This is my delete function:</p>

<pre><code>public async deleteAllComponents(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.componentsTab.click();

    // get list of all current components
    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);
    const componentNames = await components.getText();

    // delete each component
    for (const name of componentNames) {
        await this.deleteComponentFromProjTree(name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the function that is throwing the stale element reference error:</p>

<pre><code>public async deleteComponentFromProjTree(componentName: string): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.componentsTab.click();
    // get new list each time because list goes stale after a component is deleted
    const components = element.all(this.projectComponentsLocator);        

    log('components found:', await components.count());
    log('deleting component:', componentName);

    const relevantComponent = await components.filter((component: ElementFinder) =&gt; {
        return component.getText().then((text: string) =&gt; {
            log('current component:', text);
            log('relevant component found:', text.includes(componentName));
            return text.includes(componentName);
        });
    })
    .first();

    await relevantComponent.click();

    const componentMenu = relevantComponent.$(this.componentMenuLocator);
    await componentMenu.click();

    if (await this.deleteOption.isPresent()) {
        await this.deleteOption.click();
        await this.confirmDeleteBtn.click();
    } else {
        // component cannot be deleted so just exit menu
        browser.actions().sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE).perform();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>When I turn on the debug logging here is what I see in the console. Why does it seem like each component is running through the filter function 4 times? When there were 2 components found the function ran 8 times, when there was only 1 it still ran 4 times. What's this all about?</p>

<p>Since the test activities themselves have similar fields to the test cases (precondition, postcondition, etc.) my naive inclination is to capture them alongside test cases (TC), with a different identifier (TA), in the same spreadsheet:</p>

<p>Imagine you have an application which does some car tax calculation, having a REST service which has a method for calculating the tax and an HTML interface with a screen to enter the required input and display the tax to pay. The HTML interface makes uses of the REST service and does nothing more than some input validation, passing the values to the REST interface and then display the tax to pay.</p>

<p>Let's assume you developed several service tests for the REST service, e.g. using SoapUI, some with invalid input (weight=0kg or price=€0) and one with valid input (weight=900kg, price=€25000).</p>

<p>The HTML interface is tested for usability, browser compatibility and other relevant quality attributes, which do not apply for the service test. The system test, e.g. using Protractor, contains some test cases concerning input validation, like an empty field for the weight of the car. You also want to verify if the tax calculation displays the correct amount to pay for valid input. Would you use the same test data as used in the service test, because you have the expected results already available, or would you deliberately choose different test data in order to implicitly test the business logic more thoroughly?</p>

<p>Let's assume two situations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You know the unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a
coverage of about 80% and you know the developers are aware of techniques like equivalence partitioning. A decent base for the 
test pyramid.</p></li>
<li><p>The unit tests concerning the tax calculation have a
coverage of just 40% and there is no time and budget to write more unit
tests and raise the coverage, unfortunately, a common situation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the latter situation, you could, of course, extend the service tests to increase coverage on a higher level, but even then you have to decide if you want to deliberately use different input values for the system test. </p>

  <p>""Is this going to be a stand-up fight sir, or a bug hunt?""
  - Hudson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've always wondered what the secrets were to writing a great bug report. Over time I've narrowed down the activity to three basic elements. </p>

<ol>
<li>Replicate: Once you've found the bug, replicate it.</li>
<li>Document: Write it down, pack in detail where necessary.</li>
<li>Communicate: Input it into the bug tracker and tell someone.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Replicate</strong> - Clearly this is the most hated step because you just made something break, why should we break it again? Unfortunately, it's part of the process. Bugs that are repeatable often give the development/implementation team a very clear view into what might be going wrong. A bug that happens one time can be very hard to track down. So, your first step if you find something wrong is to try and make it happen again. This is why it's critical that you mentally keep track of what you're doing and what you've clicked. Certain combinations can yield bugs, while others won't.</p>

<p><strong>Document</strong> - The only thing worse than a bug is a bug without any details. For example, what's wrong with the following bug report?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My order failed. I think it is broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the fact that your order failed, there's no detail! Examples of very excellent detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steps to repeat the bug (see Step 1)</li>
<li>What you were expecting vs. what you got</li>
<li>Error messages that appear on the page</li>
<li>What browser/operating system were you using</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you were to rewrite the bug like the following - this will make it easier for the implementation team to investigate and solve the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm using the following:
  OS: Mac OS X (10.4.9)
  Browser: Firefox 2.0.0.3</p>
  
  <p>My order for a snuggle puppies on yoursitehere.com wouldn't go
  through and I'm not sure why. When I try to place the order, I end up on
  the order entry page with the following error message: ""We're sorry, our
  records indicate another order has already been placed....""
  I was expecting to end up on the receipt page with a confirmation message
  and with a confirmation email in my inbox and instead I'm getting an error.</p>
  
  <p>Try the following steps:</p>
  
  <p>Your steps here</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Communicate</strong> - In order for a bug to get corrected, the implementation team needs to know about it. This doesn't end up being as plodding as it sounds. But the sooner you let your primary developer/project manager/testing know the sooner it can be put into the queue to be fixed.</p>

<p>This is how I've done it ... but what makes a great bug report in your mind? </p>

  <p>I'm building a solo project myself. (Java backend, Java AWT frontend. No lectures about AWT vs swing vs *wt, please :-))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's fairly straightforward</p>

<p>Primary server - keeps user information
Content server - keeps content information
Client - the user interface</p>

<p>Client opens up and connects to the primary server. Depending on the content, the connection gets bounced to the proper content server (of course, the primary and content servers do some communication to prepare the authorization of the new client coming in.)</p>

<p>At what point should I be writing tests? I want to balance the testing aspect of it with making progress in development, and I'm not sure what the proper balance of that is. I'm much more concerned about the front end than I am about the back end. I pretty much see the GUI as a simple mechanism for calling back-end functionality with a lot of cool pictures. :-)</p>

<p>Obviously there are paradigms like TDD which would dictate no code is written without a test. But this is just my moonlighting project that I do in my spare time. It's mostly for fun (although I'd love to see a profit off it.)</p>

<p>There's currently between 30-40 classes. There are currently no tests of any kind (unit, functional, integration are what I plan to do eventually.)</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
[...]
def main(argv):
    [...]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    return main(sys.argv) # This line allegedly not covered by tests
</code></pre>

<p>I do have a test for it! foo/tests/test_commands.py:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest
class CommandsTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_direct_call(self):
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'foo/commands.py', 'help'], stdout=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        self.assertTrue(stdout.startswith('usage:'))
        self.assertEquals(0, proc.returncode)
</code></pre>

<p>(That's not my actual test, but it's along those lines.)</p>

<p>I use nose as my test runner:</p>

<pre><code>nosetests --cover-erase --cover-tests --with-coverage --cover-package=foo -vs foo
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this particular statement isn't considered ""covered"", because I use plain python instead of coverage.py (or python-coverage as its called on Ubuntu). I could change it to python-coverage, but I don't really want to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>It may not be available.</li>
<li>If it is available, it may be named differently.</li>
<li>It's ok if someone wants to run the test suite without the coverage stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I have a dreadful hack to do it:</p>

<pre><code>interpreter = 'coverage' in sys.modules ['python-coverage', 'run'] or ['python']
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly the most readable code, but imagine the irony of using the more readable approach:</p>

<pre><code>if 'coverage' in sys.modules:
    interpreter = ['python-coverage', 'run']
else:
    interpreter = ['python']
</code></pre>

<p>...only to realise that the ""else:"" branch ends up not getting called when coverage is enabled, so I just have another line of code that's not exercised by unit tests.</p>

<p>My goal is to fail the test suite if there isn't 100% coverage. I ""need"" the statement in foo/commands.py because it's a very convenient way to test things during development (in actual installs, it'll use distutils console_scripts magic to call into this file).</p>

<p>Ideas? Prior art? Anything?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: 100% coverage is by no means a guarantee that everything is great. Less than 100% is a guarantee, though, that there's something you're not testing. I can easily verify the 100% coverage, so I see no reason not to.</p>

For example, say I have two tests, where the second is dependent on the success of the first. I can add dependency (using <code>TestNG</code>) on the first test so that the second is executed only when the first succeeds.</p>

<p>But most programmers (I suppose <code>xUnit</code> users) support independent tests. That is, instead of being dependent on the first test, the second would need to bring the system to the right state before executing. To achieve this, the second test might invoke some common methods which would do the same operations as that of the first.</p>

<p>The problem I see with this approach is execution duplication. The first test is executed. Then the ""<strong>independent</strong>"" second test is executed (or it could be executed before the first, as there is no order of execution) which would essentially do the same things as the first test in order to bring the system back to a state where the second can be executed. So, this would take more time over all.</p>

<p>Do you write independent tests? If so, how do you cope up with execution time?</p>

<ul>
<li>Concrete relevant(newer?) examples of why one choice is better than the other</li>
<li>OR, a concrete suggestion of why using a different language is the better choice over using Javascript to test the live API</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm new to Angular and just started a job working on QA for a project with a front end written in Angular.  I'm planning on writing e2e for the UI in Protractor with Jasmine. I need to write roughly equivalent e2e tests for the API, I know I <em>don't</em> want mocking tests (Unit tests will be written in Karma or in the C# back end directly, I'm still working that out). I want to hit the live endpoints.  </p>

<p>My thought was to use Javascript for my testing, to keep the list of languages being used in the product short. I've narrowed down to using either Jasmine with FrisbyJS or Mocha and Chai. I want to choose something that will survive for the foreseeable future, but at the least the next 2 years. </p>

<p><strong>Jasmine and FrisbyJS</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using Jasmine already with Protractor/Karma</li>
<li>FrisbyJS seems easy enough to use once setup</li>
<li>Does do testing of live API endpoints easily</li>
<li>Jasmine is an industry standard and will survive long-term</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frisby seems to have gone through a major rewrite and all tutorials I find are from &lt;= 2015 and before this rewrite that now uses Jest instead of Jasmine-Node to run the tests and the documentation on the github page is just wrong in places and I'm having to figure out how to run things I don't even know how to use yet (I have no issue struggling through learning if it's the best choice though!)</li>
<li>Lack of newer examples on how to use the framework</li>
<li>Still in the middle of rewrite</li>
<li>Unsure of longevity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mocha and Chai</strong></p>

<p>Pros: </p>

<ul>
<li>Seem to be a lot of newer tutorials</li>
<li>Does do testing of live API endpoints easily</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Not using Jasmine, so new testers will have to learn both Jasmine (which is being using with Protractor for UI) and Mocha (maybe this isn't a big deal)</li>
<li>Seems newer, so unsure of the longevity of the framework/module</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some Background Considerations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I've researched using PostMan or SoapUI for testing of live API (what's the term for this too please??) endpoints, but determined I'm going to have to code regardless, so I'd prefer to not introduce another language or have to pay for another service when I can make languages I have already work</li>
<li>I have a lot of experience using Java and TestNG to do live API and UI testing (with a custom wrapper library built around Selenium), so I know what it should look like in general</li>
<li>I'm hoping to reach out to someone with more experience in this with an Angular background as I am the QA expert at my position and I have no one here I can physically pester with questions. </li>
</ul>

<p>I apologize if this is too much an opinion question.  If there's another place I should post this please direct me and I'll remedy with a removal of this question. </p>

<p>What I want to accomplish is elegant, extendable page load time logging within my page object architecture. Most new pages are loaded as the result of some action, such as a click on a previous page. The problem is that when an action is performed, the WebDriver does not give control back to the Selenium code until the page has loaded. This causes the reported time elapsed to be much less than it actually is from a user perspective.</p>

<p>Here is some code that represents what I'm trying to do.</p>

<pre><code>class LoginPage : Page
{
    public WelcomePage Login()
    {
        EnterUserName();
        EnterPassword();
        // Really DON'T want to start a timer here and then access it in the Page constructor, if possible.
        ClickContinueButton(); // Performs driver.FindElement(continueButtonLocator).Click();
        return new WelcomePage();
    }
}

class WelcomePage : Page
{
    public override void WaitForLoad()
    {
        // Wait until some element exists to indicate page has completely loaded.
    }
}

abstract class Page
{
    long loadTime;

    // Base constructor
    // Start a timer, verify page load, and stop the timer.
    public Page()
    {
        // This isn't called until the browser loading indicator has stopped.
        timer = StopWatch.StartNew();
        WaitForLoad();
        loadTime = timer.EllapsedMilliseconds;
    }

    protected abstract void WaitForLoad();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Has anyone else come up with a solution to this problem?</p>

<p>The next-best solution I can think of right now is to have a global timer that restarts whenever an action like a click is performed. On the base Page class, I have generic methods for performing those actions, so one of those might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void ClickElement(By locator)
{
    IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(locator);
    GlobalTimer.Restart();
    element.Click();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the Page constructor would just access that after verifying load completion:</p>

<pre><code>public Page()
{
    WaitForLoad();
    loadTime = GlobablTimer.EllapsedMilliseconds;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like there has to be a better way of doing this, but I haven't come across a well-defined pattern in my searching.</p>

<p>The development team are looking to integrate automated testing into the development methodology/ life cycle, and I have been given the task of researching testing frameworks that we could look to implement/ use with our code.</p>

<p>I have been following the Jasmine/ Karma tutorial at <a href=""https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-2</a>, for setting up Jasmine/ Karma as the testing suite for an AngularJS app, and while it does seem to provide some useful tools/ methods for testing the code, and could certainly be useful, I haven't come across anything in the tutorial that indicates that it's possible to use this framework to simulate user interaction with the front end, and test the application's responses to user interaction... which is what we are specifically looking to automate.</p>

<p>All of the tests that the tutorial runs through with you seem to be for testing the logic of the code written- none of them seem to test for user interaction with the front end (the web elements).</p>

<p>The reason we're looking to automate this testing is because as we add new features/ fix bugs &amp; role the versions out to our customers, we will need to test everything on the front end every time, to ensure that none of the changes we've made have broken anything that our clients are using/ will need to use. It would save us a huge amount of time and effort if we could just run a batch of scripts against every version of the software we release, to test all of the front end elements that haven't changed between versions.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I could use Jasmine/ Karma to do this, or is there another tool that would be better suited to specifically testing the user interaction with the application?</p>

<p>After doing a bit of research, and asking on here about what frameworks would be best to use to enable the testing functionality that I require, I have decided to use Protractor as the testing framework for my app.</p>

<p>I am following the <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial</a> to try and get Protractor up and running with my application (i.e. with my existing app, not the Super Calculator application that the tutorial references), but am encountering a problem:</p>

<p>The way my development environment is set up, is that I am doing all of the development of the AngularJS app on my local Windows machine, and using a Unix VM (running CentOS) to serve my app's front-end using <code>grunt</code>.</p>

<p>I have run through the setup steps in the tutorial, and have all of that set up correctly. However, on Step 0, after creating the <code>spec.js</code> &amp; <code>conf.js</code> files as instructed, when I then run:</p>

<pre><code>protractor conf.js

<p>in the command line, I get the following output:</p>

<p>My guess is that this is happening because of the address/ port I'm using when running it (i.e. the address/ port used on the VM)?</p>

<p>Would that be the case? If so, what IP address/ port should I be using? The port that I have Karma set up on is: 9876- should I be using this port, rather than the one from the tutorial (4444)? Or if not, how can I resolve this issue?</p>

"29730","1","29733","","2017-09-21 14:26:57","","1","696","<p>I recently started working on an application that has been written in AngularJS, and have been tasked with setting up automated testing for the app (all of the testing that has been done as part of the development life cycle to date appears to have been done manually).</p>

<p>I have not used automated testing in any of my previous roles, so this is quite new to me. After doing a bit of research, and asking for recommendations on here as to what the best framework to use would be for this application, I have decided to use <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org/#/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protractor</a>.</p>

<p>I have gone through the tutorial on their website, to get an understanding for how it works &amp; what it does, etc, and am now looking to start integrating it into the existing application, which I appreciate/ expect will be a bit more complicated than setting up the testing framework/ suite at the start of a project, &amp; building it in parallel with the development of the application, as I will essentially have to go back through the application (and code), and document everything that will need to be tested, how it should be tested, pass/ fail criteria, etc.</p>

<p>For now though, I just want to set up a couple of very simple tests to ensure that I have Protractor up and running with my app correctly. I can then look to design &amp; implement the more thorough/ involved tests later, once I have the framework set up.</p>

<p>I want to set Protractor up for use within my development environment, but am having a bit of difficulty doing this... My environment is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 10 PC</li>
<li>Unix VM running CentOS 7</li>
<li>Python 3.4 running the backend on the VM</li>
<li>Using <code>grunt serve</code> to serve the front end on the VM</li>
</ul>

<p>I am following through the <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial</a> again, this time trying to apply it to my existing application, so that I can start writing tests for it.</p>

<p>I have the <code>conf.js</code> file written as indicated in the tutorial:</p>

<pre><code>exports.config = {
    framework: 'jasmine',
    seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
    specs: ['spec.js'],
    multiCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'firefox'
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and have the <code>spec.js</code> file written as indicated in the tutorial, just with the address that the browser should point to set to the local address of my VM:</p>

<pre><code>describe('My App', function() {
    it('should hit the VM hosted site', function() {
        browser.get('192.168.1.212:8080');

        //Write tests here
        //element(by.model('toolbar-btn-on')).sendKeys('write first app test');
        //element(by.css

        //Test to get app title:
        expect(browser.getTitle()).toEqual('title of my app');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>These files, &amp; my whole application repository is stored on a network drive which I have mapped to both my local machine &amp; the VM. </p>

<p>If I open a browser on the VM, and browse to <code>localhost:8080/#/pages/login</code>, I am presented with the log in page for my AngularJS app.</p>

<p>If I open a browser on my local windows machine, and browse to  <code>192.168.1.212:8080/#/pages/login</code>, I am presented with the same log in page for my AngularJS app, so it is clear that my app is up and running, Python is serving the back end, and Grunt is serving the front end, all working correctly.</p>

<p>However, when I run:</p>

<pre><code>protractor conf.js
</code></pre>

<p>from the command line, as indicated at the end of 'Step 0 - Write a test' in the tutorial, although the browser opens &amp; closes again very quickly, as the tutorial indicates it should, it states that the output should say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 tests, 1 assertion, 0 failures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the output in my console actually shows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So it appears that my test doesn't like the fact that I am asking it to 'get' the browser at the VM's IP address (i.e. not my local computer's IP address). Is there a reason for this? How can I set Protractor to run my tests against a version of my application that's hosted on the VM, rather than a live site, or a version hosted on my local development machine?</p>

<p>We currently have a rather rich subset of end-to-end tests for our AngularJS applications. And, we do get a lot of visual/layout/design issues on every single development iteration. Usually, we do not cover this kind of issues with end-to-end tests and testing the fixes manually. The reasoning was always - too hard, too fragile, too expensive to automate.</p>

<p>In some cases though, <em>a style of an element or block on a page is really critical for an end-user</em> and it would make sense to have an automated end-to-end test checking it. We try to check the colors, font styles and other CSS properties inside our Protractor tests, but it is still checking only these specific things and not an element or part of a page as a whole. Plus, the assertions themselves are not readable and easy to break, for example:</p>

<pre><code>expect(somePage.someElement.getCssValue(""background-color"")).toEqual(""rgba(255, 211, 205, 1)"");
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>We are thinking of adding some sort of a visual component to our tests. Ideally, comparing screenshots of what we expect an element to look like and how it actually looks. But, there are a lot of open questions at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>how reliable can it be - would it depend on the browser, resolution and other parameters of the test machine setup?</li>
<li>is it possible to integrate with our existing Protractor test codebase or we need a separate specialized tool for that?</li>
<li>test result reporting - how would we present the test results?</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you done something similar and how did you address the above mentioned issues? Was it worth the cost of maintenance?</p>

<p>I believe I have the correct file structure, using ""__tests__"" and my test file ""api.spec.js"" in that folder, but I might have something wrong going on. Disclaimer: I'm brand new to Javascript and all related knowledge. I previously worked on Java. </p>

<p>I'm working on a proof of concept using Frisby with Jasmine to write live API tests.  My current project structure is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>__tests__

<ul>
<li>helpers

<ul>
<li>environment.js</li>
</ul></li>
<li>api.spec.js</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The file contents are as follows:</p>

<p>environment.js</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
    oneApiUrl: ""https://mywebsite.net/"",
    twoApiUrl: ""https://myotherwebsite.com/projectpoint/"",
    dashboardProjectsApi: 'api/dashboard/projects/get',
    token: 'tokenstringhere',
};
</code></pre>

<p>api.spec.js</p>

<pre><code>const frisby = require('frisby');
const environment = require('./helpers/environment.js');


frisby.globalSetup({
    request: {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + environment.token,
        }
    }
});

describe('Dashboard api', function () {
    it('should return list of projects this user can access', function (done) {
        frisby.get(environment.oneApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)
            .expect('status', 200)
            .done(done);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's not the test, as this works if I do <code>jasmine-node .\api.spec.js</code>.  I can go with using <code>jasmine-node</code>, but there's benefits to using <code>jest</code> and I <em>would</em> like to know why this isn't working. </p>

<p>I tried Googling the error, but this error typically comes from issues related to a javascript website, doubling up on imports in the html, etc. I don't think mine is related to that, as I'm trying to run the js file like one would run python, with an interpreter. (As far as I understand.)</p>

<p>Any suggestions/critiques are appreciated!</p>

<p>I'm told to specialize towards one job. If you do everything you can't progress. I'm uncertain whether I should perform only one specific job or do security testing, too.</p>

  <p>Implicit wait is not considered a good practice because different browsers have different loading times and implicit wait will cause
  different results in different browsers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have tried to find the blog where I read this, but couldn't find it. But, a similar view is expressed in <a href=""http://www.testingdiaries.com/selenium-webdriver-wait/"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a> article.</p>

<p>Next quote is from <a href=""http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/selenium-webdriver-waits-selenium-tutorial-15/"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>here</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When compared to Explicit wait, Implicit wait is transparent and
  uncomplicated. The syntax and approach is simpler than explicit wait.
  Being easy and simple to apply, implicit wait introduces a few
  drawbacks as well. It gives rise to the test script execution time as
  each of the command would be ceased to wait for a stipulated amount of
  time before resuming the execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:
Is it a bad practice to use implicit wait? Should one use <strong>only</strong> explicit wait?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: From the Selenium Documentation, it is clear that one should not use both the waits together. I am asking only about implicit wait.</p>

The tool should also handle cookie-management just like any Web browser does.</p>

<p>Additional nice-to-have requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tool should allow scripting tests in Java, as most of the team is skilled in Java</li>
</ul>

<p>So far I have considered multiple tool but each of them has some drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://jmeter.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JMeter</a>, apart from nice GUI, provides also an API but it seems quite rusty and cumbersome to use. Also, I'm not sure if I can define requests dynamically, based on the results of previous request. Does it?</li>
<li><a href=""http://grinder.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Grinder</a> is Java framework, but test cases must be scripted in Jython. This requires the team to learn Python and also introduces some incompatibility problems: I had hard time to reuse some existing Python libraries. On the other side, I needed to pay some more attention when casting Java objects into Python. Why, the hack, guys couldn't make Java framework with Java test cases?</li>
<li><a href=""http://gatling.io/#/"" rel=""nofollow"">Gatling</a> has quite intuitive DSL for defining requests programmatically (almost like REST-Assured), but is in Scala. That's a cool language but again we're not proficient in it.</li>
<li>I wanted to reuse framework for functional REST tests, <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/"" rel=""nofollow"">REST-Assured</a>, but I've read, it introduces much overhead to the performance tests + I would need to add support for reporting myself.</li>

We are using Appium capabilities to launch the APK under test on an emulator and then launching the tests.  The problem is that in our latest build our APK now checks for another APK and if it's not installed it will prompt the user to install it.  So now the scripts do not work because I'm not clicking the 'Install' or 'Cancel' button on the install process.  My question is what is the best way to fix this so that my tests aren't failing.  I'm thinking either-
1.) Install the second SDK before my app has a chance to check for it (I do not need to test that now), I'm using the scripts for regression of existing functionality
2.  Have the scripts click the ""Install"" button.  </p>

<p>The problem with #1 is that I don't see how to install more than 1 APK using the Android Set Capabilities.  The problem with #2 is that I'm not sure how to inspect the elements on the install package and click Install?</p>

<p>So my question- Can you use setCapabilites to install more than 1 APK or is it possible to use Appium to prompt an install?</p>

Generally speaking, these applications are typically deployed as a suite, installed on different machines, and communicate via a complex, undocumented, and proprietary protocol.  They also communicate with vendors via socket or serial to send/receive data.</p>

<p>I want to introduce automated integration testing for these applications, but haven't found many tools that advertise this feature.  <a href=""http://smartbear.com/products/qa-tools/automated-testing-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">TestComplete</a> offers what they call ""<a href=""http://support.smartbear.com/articles/testcomplete/distributed-testing-tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">distributed testing</a>,"" but after using it in a free trial I'm not real impressed with how it works.  It just doesn't seem to have this use case in mind.  I'm still working with SmartBear to see if there's something that can simplify what I'm trying to do.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> can anyone recommend a tool for testing a suite of applications across multiple machines, assuming that a test on one machine might require an action on another machine?  </p>

<p>I realize I should test in isolation and simulate/mock the other machines, but the communications between the machines is complicated enough that it's a bit of a non-starter for me.  I can revisit this if there aren't any great tools for doing this, but it no longer becomes a good integration test in my eyes.  I do intend to simulate the vendors' data feeds since they are generally simple and there's no other option since we don't have their software.</p>

<pre><code>public double getBalance()

<p>The coverage summary from Emma says that it has 3 blocks</p>

<p>I was wondering how this method has three blocks unless it was counting
the jvm byte codes, and outputting the total number of byte codes as the
number of blocks. Given below is the dis-assembly for comparison</p>

<pre><code>public double getBalance();
  Code:

   1: getfield  #8; //Field balance:D

</code></pre>

<p>This seems to hold true for other methods too. Is my finding correct?</p>

<pre><code>public void addTransaction(double amount)
{
     this.transactions.add(amount);
}

----------------
[10]addTransaction (double):            100% (1/1) 100% (7/7)   100% (2/2)

<p>These templates are all manually written Microsoft Word documents (this is a requirement. A management system like EA has not been widely accepted).</p>

<p>Has anyone found an efficient (low risk of copy&amp;paste errors, preserving IDs between documents, etc) way of using Word 2010 features to allow document item cross-referencing?

<p>For example, if I could create a requirement as a ""figure"", and I insert a caption, I get automatic generation of number and title, which can be referenced later (I can cross-reference either the caption number or the caption title, as required). A built-in bonus is that the ""List of figures"" automatically lists the defined figures (ID and caption).</p>

<p>Right now I'm having to create individual bookmarks - 1 for ID (<strong>SRS-O-001</strong>) and 1 for title (<strong>No blue M&amp;Ms allowed</strong>), and take care to reference the appropriate bookmark elsewhere in the document.</p>

<p>If I use section level (e.g. <strong>3.3.1 No blue M&amp;M's</strong>) it places an artificial constraint on the document layout (code-smell).</p>

<p>I have found that these bookmark definitions can be copied from document to document (e.g. RS to ADD) where they can be referenced again (of course, they have to manually maintained during specification change cycles).</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It seems like the customer will accept VBA macro code to parse a Word style and generate a table. This opens up the possibility of keeping the requirements and tests (etc) in a database or spreadsheet, and dynamically adding content to the Word documents...</p>

One of the requirements - <strong>3 interface languages</strong> user may switch from any page (place) of the solution.</p>

<p>So the question is that simple: is there any common practice to estimate localization testing as <strong>percentage</strong> of overall functional testing efforts?</p>

<p>The following assumptions / aspects are actual as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 of 3 languages are common and do not require any special skills for checking from QA team; the 3rd language is uncommon (however, not TOTALLY different, as e.g. English and Japanese). Any criteria for estimations relating that 3rd language, perhaps x2 / x3 efforts required for localization testing of common language?</li>
<li>Which approach is better (or easier to explain) - %% based on overall functional testing efforts <strong>OR</strong> based on the approximate number of separate web portal pages?</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment the following makes sense for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>5% of overall testing efforts (i.e. about <strong>75 hrs</strong>) for common language localization testing;</li>
<li>Approx. 10-15%, i.e. about <strong>200 hrs</strong> for UNcommon language localization testing.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the record - web portal will have about 120-140 <strong>different types</strong> of pages that should have localized elements.</p>

<p>Any suggestions / help / ideas / approach (as best - based on real experience / cases) are highly appreciated!</p>

<p>P.S. no sample link available - it's requirements refining stage.</p>

We provide both desktop and web applications to our clients.  After doing a lot of research and testing, I landed on Selenium for the web tests because it seemed easiest and most powerful while still giving me total control over my tests.  For desktop applications, I initially landed on Visual Studio's own Coded UI Tests, as it was the only GUI tester that gave consistent results.  However, Selenium uses NUnit and Coded UI tests use Microsoft's own test framework.  My question is, is there a framework that I can use to run both web tests and GUI tests?  I'd prefer to continue to use Selenium if possible.  Most other GUI testing applications I've tried are inconsistent or don't allow programming.  I can obviously just bypass the GUI and call our application's methods directly, but if there is a way to test the GUI as well, that would be preferred.  Any suggestions that use C# would be particularly appreciated.  </p>

<pre><code>java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar 
     -htmlSuite ""*firefox C:\Users\rplantik\Portables\selenium\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.exe""

      ""testresults.html""
</code></pre>

<p>The Jetty server was started, but it crushed after having issued the info message <code>Preparing Firefox profile...</code></p>

<p>I found out that there is another portable app, called FirefoxPortable2ndProfile, which allows you to start FirefoxPortable with another than the built-in profile. I therefore downloaded that application, too, and modified the command as follows, to include the path to the different profile: </p>

<pre><code>java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar 
     -firefoxProfileTemplate C:\Users\rplantik\Portables\selenium\FirefoxPortable2ndProfile\Data\profile 
     -htmlSuite ""*firefox C:\Users\rplantik\Portables\selenium\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.exe""

      ""C:\Users\rplantik\Portables\selenium\rest\testsuite.html"" 
      ""testresults.html""
</code></pre>

<p>Now it seems that the profile was created successfully (<code>Preparing Firefox profile...</code> seems to be executed as intended - for a short moment, the ""Firefox"" logo pops up), then the message <code>Launching Firefox...</code> appears, and indeed a firefox application is started. </p>

<p>But after that, the test suite is not executed. Instead, the browser stays on the default site, and there is no further action until I stop the process in the console.</p>

We had recently some problems with buggy deployments scripts (both manual and automated) that set up DB incorrectly or incompletely. So his idea is to have SELECT queries that will check the status of DB to provide quick feedback, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(*) &gt; 0 FROM user_table;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, many DB problems will be discovered by end-to-end tests, but having a number of tests cases checking directly DB will help us with troubleshooting and shorten the feedback loop.</p>

<p>I would like to add such DB checks as Jenkins jobs and provide to DBA some way (natural for him) to express such test cases. I found two approaches to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Translate SQL queries to JUnit tests, e.g. using <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/dbassert/"" rel=""nofollow"">DBAssert</a> library:</p>

<pre><code>//Set condition to search record by. 
dbAssert.table(""authors"").where(""id"", 123).and(""last_name"", ""Coupland"") ; 

// assert customers _name_ column equals Douglas value in database.
dbAssert.assert_column(""name"", ""Douglas"");
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Embed SQL queries into bash scripts, as proposed <a href=""http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/01/23/lowtech-monitoring-with-jenkins/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -l
CHECK=`mysql -u jenkins -ppassword -h 192.168.56.101 -BNe 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo_db.jobs WHERE depth &gt;= 100'`
exit ${CHECK}

<p>We've got both navigation and bookmark based Selenium tests.  The test code for the page under test is in a separate method that is called by test methods ending in either Bookmark or Nav.  Navigation to the page under test is called from the setUp method, but exceptions that occur when navigating don't get treated as test failures because they are running in setUp.  An easy solution that we don't like would be adding a call to the navigation method as the first line of each Nav test.  Is there an alterantive way to handle our navigation?</p>

<p>I'm working on an automation suite and I've run into an annoying problem when it comes to switching windows.  I have a script which clicks a button which opens in a new window.  I'm able to switch to that new window but only intermittently.  Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>    mainWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
    objAdminPage.clickButtonForNewWindow();

    Set&lt;String&gt; handles = driver.getWindowHandles();
    System.out.println(handles);
    System.out.println(""This is the main handle "" + mainWindowHandle);

    for(String winHandle : handles){
        System.out.println(""In the loop "" + handles);
        if(!winHandle.equals(mainWindowHandle)){    
            driver.switchTo().window(winHandle);    
            System.out.println(winHandle);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be the standard way of doing things.  The script saves the current window handle, then gets all handles, loops over them until it finds the one which isn't the current window and the driver switches to it.  And this works.....sort of.  Often when I run the script it won't switch to the new window, leading to failed tests and badness.  I've scattered sysouts through the code as you can see and I've noticed that on failure I'm only getting one handle in the handles set, not both.  What seems to be happening is that the system is charging ahead and the set is being created before Selenium can get both handles.</p>

<p>I'm able to get this to run reliably if I make a Thread.sleep(1000) call prior to creating the set but I really don't like having to do this.  It seems inelegant and I've not seen this being necessary elsewhere.  If anyone has any better solutions or knows why I'm having to hack the system like this I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

"12713","1","24395","","2015-04-16 20:46:18","","2","856","<p>I'm facing an issue when application I'm testing is opening a second level popup (I mean, a popup that rises another popup). I'm using Selenium for Java, version 2.42.2, with IE Driver.</p>

<p>My code currently manages all other flows and single pop ups windows, but when a second level popup appears my webdriver object gets irresponsive and just stuck in any method that try to get invoked. When this happens, I need to manually close the popup window and then driver method continues the execution of invoked method.</p>

<p>Maybe it worth mentioning, if I call the second popup from the main page (not from another popup) I am able to manage it without problems, so the problem seems to be related with the number of nested windows more than a specific problem for the page.</p>

<p>Take a look on below code:</p>

<pre><code>String url = ""/example.jsp""
int counter = 0;
boolean windowDetected = false;

// Waiting until page with given url gets detected
// It tries 10 times before it continues
while (counter++ &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; !windowDetected) {         

  waitForSeconds(1); // Just invokes Thread.sleep method, 

  System.out.println(""before getting handlers, iteration "" + counter + "" of 10"");   
  Set&lt;String&gt; handlers = driver.getWindowHandles();
  System.out.println(""after getting handlers, number of handlers: "" + handlers.size());

  for (String handler : handlers) {

    try {
      System.out.println(""Moving to "" + handler);
      driver.switchTo().window(handler);
    }
    catch (NoSuchWindowException e) {
      System.out.println(""Window not found, it probably redirected to a different window"");
      break;
    }

    if (driver.getCurrentUrl().contains(url)) {
      windowDetected = true;
      waitForPageLoading(); // It just verify current page status to be completed
      break;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am able to position properly the driver in specific window with above code in other application pages, but when having the second level popup it just hangs on line Set handlers = driver.getWindowHandles(); that is the first method called on driver object after popup appeared. Similarly, if I had called another driver method like driver.getPageSource() the same would have happened in that method.</p>

<p>I am not able to change application structure (my scope is only for testing it), so doing changes in web application code is not an option for me now. I have read on different options like trying Robot class, but I think it will be difficult to implement with more complex pages and difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>Any idea of how can I solve this issue? Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>The empty place holder is populated when the node is expanded. I do not know any of the ID's when my script runs, all that I know is the text of the link (""This is the text I know"").</p>

<p>The IDs of the elements are, of course, available at run time, and I can construct the ID of the various elements I need to use by replacing the prefix.</p>

<p>I was able to find_element_by_xpath the first entry:</p>

<p>However, that string does not work when I issue it from Selenium using find_elements_by_xpath(). (I use the plural version because several entries match (""A"", ""A1"", ""A2"") a single left fragment, just look for the one that I want in that list.)</p>

<p>The code that I wrote is basically:</p>

<pre><code>xpath = ""//""
segments = [ ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ...]
for segment in segments:
  xpath += ""a[contains(text(),'%s')]"" % segment
  anchors = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(xpath)
  subTreeId = None
  for anchor in anchors:
    if anchor.text == segment:
      id = anchor.get_attribute(""id"")

<p>The first iteration works and opens the first level of sub-tree, however, the second pass fails with this string:</p>

<pre><code>//a[contains(text(),'A')]/../../../../../..//div[@id='subtreeContainer_$div$fileFolder_div_ff8']//a[contains(text(),'B')]
</code></pre>

<p>which is the same as the one above and I can cut-n-paste this string into FirePath and it finds the node (nodes, actually, ""B"", ""B1"", ""B2"", ...) - sorry to repeat myself.</p>

<p>My thinking is that when I ""click"" the ""openId"" element, Selenium's concept of the ""current node"" changes and so should the xpath, however, I was not able to get that concept to work by not carrying the prior xpath forward (I changed the ""+="" to just ""="" for the xpath assignment just before the ""break"".</p>

To overcome this problem, we can have verify which will make test case fail, but allowing test execution to proceed rather than getting aborted.</p>

<p>I doubt there is any such built in approach in testNG. I do understand that best practices say, there should not be multiple asserts in same test case.</p>

<p>But, in practical world, we do come across scenarios where we need to have multiple checkpoints in one test case and we don't want our test method to abort because of one check point failure (test execution should proceed despite failure).</p>

<p>How can we use a soft assert mechanism, similar to verify, which will not abort test method when there is a checkpoint failure.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>@Test(dataProvider = ""getMailUrl"")
public void testMail(email,subject);
Assert.assertFalse(subject.isEmpty);//1st checkpoint
Assert.assertNotNull(email); //2nd checkpoint
Assert.assertEquals(email, ""feedback@yoursite.com""); //3rd checkpoint
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want test execution to proceed, even if the 1st checkpoint (validation of subject being not empty) fails. Definitely we will be not be using assert (hard assert). We will need concept of soft assert similar to verify (facilitated by Junit). </p>

<p>I understand, we have to build a customListener implementing TestNG interfaces or extending existing listeners such as TestListenerAdapter.<br>

(""go here, do this, launch this, tell me what happens."") Most of what needs to be done is setting up tests in a web app and then poking some things on a kiosk and scanning some barcodes.</p>

<p>I had an ingenious idea convert my scripting from vb to js and use flex my jQuery knowledge so my scripts would be browser agnostic. This doesn't work for a couple reasons. You can't import js outside of the browser, and jQuery requires a window with a document. I've looked into testing platforms like Selenium as well as PhantomJS/SlimerJS/CasperJS and they all require an installation of some sort. Especially if I want to eventually automate actions on kiosks installations are out of the question. I'd also prefer avoiding installing on the testers PCs so much that I'd rather just continue to vbscript for IE.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me toward a solution I might be overlooking? Perhaps a portable automation app, or vbscript library which won't care what browser may be opened when the script is launched?</p>

<p>Nothing happens at this point and no test results are showing in my Saucelabs dashboard.</p>

<p>Here is my Protractor config file:</p>

<pre><code> exports.config = {
      framework: 'jasmine',
      sauceUser: 'username',
      sauceKey: 'key',
      sauceSeleniumAddress: 'ondemand.saucelabs.com:80',

      }
 };
</code></pre>

<p>I can run my test locally using my local selenium server, but I can't get the tests to run in saucelabs.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I haven't installed anything specific to saucelabs at this point, I just updated my config file with the saucelabs specific properties.</p>

<p>After doing some research into the various automated testing suites available, I decided to use <a href=""http://protractortest.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protractor</a>, as it appears to provide all of the functionality that we will need, and also seems to be well documented &amp; maintained.</p>

<p>I have successfully got Protractor set up and running with our application, and am now starting to design &amp; implement the tests that we will require in order to ensure the functionality &amp; stability of the product.</p>

<p>As things currently stand, all of the tests I have written are in the <code>spec.js</code> file in a 'testing' folder within the project structure, and I have been using comments to document that file, and keep the tests grouped with other similar tests/ tests for the same 'part' of the software.</p>

<p>Since I am relatively new to automated testing, my question is: what is the best practice for developing an automated test suite that will be run on every release of your software? Is it best to define all of the tests within a single file (i.e. the <code>spec.js</code> file I'm currently using), or is it better to have separate files for each part of the software you're testing, in order to keep the tests more structured? What are the reasons for/ against either approach? Or is it simply a case of preference?</p>

<p>I know I can indicate a filter of sorts by using a word after the keyword jest in the command line. For example, running `jest dashboard' when there are 2 test files, 'dashboard.api.spec.js' and 'navigation.api.spec.js', will only run the tests in 'dashboard.api.spec.js'. But what if I have a subset of dashboard tests in 'dashboard.api.spec.js' that I consider smoke tests that I want to be able to pinpoint to run? </p>

<p>I've seen the documentation on 'fit' and 'fdescribe', but that requires the user to modify the source code.  I'd prefer to be able to say something like jest --tags='smoke'. I found something similar on the jest github: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/2846"" rel=""noreferrer"">Issue 2846</a>, but it seems it was shot down in August 2017. </p>

<p>Is there another module or way to configure jest short of making multiple files with different subsets of tests that would fit what I'm trying to accomplish? </p>

"29820","1","29822","","2017-09-26 13:59:00","","4","11484","<p>I have just recently started working on integrating a test framework into my AngularJS application, using <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protractor</a> do build the test cases &amp; run the tests.</p>

<p>Having never used automated testing before, I am still new to it, and still getting to grips with how it works, how to write the test scripts, etc.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a test to check that the correct 'sub-menu' is displayed when the user hovers the cursor over a button on the main navigation bar. The test currently looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>it('should display the Pages menu', function() {
    browser.actions().mouseMove(pagesMenuBtn).perform();
    browser.pause();
    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();
    browser.pause();
    browser.actions().mouseMove(userCircle).perform();
    browser.pause();
    expect(pageVarBrowser.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>pagesMenuBtn</code> is the menu button that will display a sub-menu listing the rest of the pages of the application when the user hovers the cursor over it- it has been defined with:</p>

<pre><code>var pagesMenuBtn = element(by.id('.nav-container &gt; model[type=href] &gt; value[""#/pages""]'));
</code></pre>

<p><code>pageVarBrowser</code> is one of the buttons that is displayed on the sub-menu shown when hovering the cursor over <code>pagesMenuBtn</code>, and is defined with:</p>

<pre><code>var pageVarBrowser = element(by.css('.nav-container &gt; model[type=href] &gt; value[""#/pages/varbrowser""]'));
</code></pre>

<p><code>userCircle</code> is simply another HTML element displayed in a different location on the page (just so that I could move the cursor somewhere off the <code>pagesMenuBtn</code>), and has been defined with:</p>

<pre><code>var userCircle = element(by.id('icon-user-circle'));
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't appear to be an issue with the syntax/ logic of the tests I've written/ am writing, but when I currently run my tests with the command <code>protractor conf.js</code>, the script starts up, and starts running through correctly, but when it reaches the above test, I get the following output in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: Timeout = Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that my tests have failed because they took too long to execute? If so, how can I fix this? Can I change the 'timeout' variable to a greater value?</p>

<p>In the console where I ran the command <code>protractor conf.js</code>, I get the following error message about the failure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Jasmine spec timed out. Resetting the WebDriver Control Flow</p>
  
  <p>Failures:</p>
  
  <p>1) MyApp should display the Pages menu
    Message:
      Failed: Timed out waiting for asynchronous Angular tasks to finish after 11 seconds. This may be because the current page is not an Angular application.

      While waiting for element with locator - Locator: By(css selector, *[id="".nav-container\ >\ model[type\=href]\ >\ value[\""#/pages\""]""]).
      The following tasks were pending:
       - $timeout: function () {
                              clearEvents(type);
                          }
       - $timeout: function setErrorMsg() {
                  // Broadcast system timeout lock event
                  $rootScope.$broadcast('um:LCK_TIMEOUT');</p>

<pre><code>           // Save the error message
            dateObj.error = (
                'Timeout error data last fetched: ' + dateObj.localFormat
            );
        }
 - $timeout: function clearTags() {
            // Go through each of the tags
            angular.forEach(tags, function (tag){
                // Clear the value
                tag.value = null;

              // If the meta information is set
                if (tag.meta) {
                    // Clear the meta raw value
                    tag.meta.raw = null;
                }
            });

           // Empty the active alarms container
            activeAlarms = {};

           // Make sure the observers notice the value change
            notifyObservers();
        }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get this test running correctly?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>So, after removing a couple of the calls to <code>browser.pause();</code> from my script, I actually got a different error message that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, *[id="".nav-container\ >\ model[type\=href]\ >\ value[\""#/pages\""]""])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it appears it doesn't like the way I'm trying to get hold of the element from the sub-menu... </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Although the initial error was complaining about a timeout, I'm now not sure that this is the cause of the issue. I removed the calls to <code>browser.pause();</code> as mentioned in my earlier edit, and then started getting the error message above instead. I suspect that this is due to the location of the element that I'm trying to find/ the structure of the HTML in which it's nested. That HTML is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li data-ng-mouseenter=""setMenuTop($event)"" ng-show=""menu.pages.length &gt; 0 || menu.upages.length &gt; 0 || canCreatePage""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#/pages"" id=""pagesMenuBtn"" target=""_self""&gt;&lt;i class=""ti-layers""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-i18n=""Pages""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;ul class=""text-capitalize""&gt;
            &lt;li ng-repeat=""page in menu.pages""&gt;&lt;a href=""#/{{page.location}}"" target=""_self""&gt;&lt;i class=""ti-angle-right""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-i18n=""{{page.title}}""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li ng-repeat=""upage in menu.upages""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""nav-menu-divider"" data-ng-if=""$index === 0""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;a href=""#/{{upage.location}}"" target=""_self""&gt;
                    &lt;i class=""ti-angle-right""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-i18n=""{{upage.title}}""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li data-ng-show=""canCreatePage""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""nav-menu-divider""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;a href=""#/pages/create"" target=""_self""&gt;
                    &lt;i class=""ti-angle-right""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-i18n=""Create Page""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The element that I'm trying to get hold of is actually one of the ones created with the line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;i class=""ti-angle-right""&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span data-i18n=""{{upage.title}}""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I want to be able to handle when an expect (which I'm pretty sure Frisby is just using the underlying Jasmine expect) fails. I'm not expecting it to fail. I don't want to use a ""toThrow"", I'm not expecting this call to fail.  I just want better error logging when an expect that I expect to pass, fails. </p>

<p>I would like the line of the failing expect, an expanded error message including a relevant stack trace, and potentially the ability to write my own error message attached, like ""The call to projects failed"".  Maybe this is a shortcoming with the Frisby module, in which case, how should I handle this from the Jasmine perspective? </p>

<p>I had this code:</p>

<pre><code>frisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)
      .expect('status', 200)
      .done(done);
</code></pre>

<p>And I was receiving this very non-descript error that was lacking any further information:</p>

<pre><code> FAIL  tests\dashboard.api.spec.js
  ● Dashboard API › should return a list of projects this user can access

    AssertionError: HTTP status 200 !== 500

      at FrisbySpec.status (node_modules/frisby/src/frisby/expects.js:25:12)

      at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7)

  Dashboard API
    × should return a list of projects this user can access (289ms)
</code></pre>

<p>I have a couple of issues with this: </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm getting a stack trace of the expects code in Frisby, not where this code is called in my tests</li>
<li>I don't get an expanded message with the error message or stack trace from the API response</li>
</ul>

<p>And then I made this code, which is better and closer to what I would want to log if any of my expects failed:</p>

<pre><code>frisby.get(environment.ApiUrl + environment.dashboardProjectsApi)
      .expect('status', 200)
      .then(function (res) {
          if (res.status != 200) {
              console.log(res);
          }
      })
      .done(done);
</code></pre>

<p>Which emits a much better message to my console.log:</p>

<pre><code>console.log tests\dashboard.api.spec.js:19

      _response: 
       Body {

         body:

         exceptionMessage: 'Sequence contains no matching element',

</code></pre>

<p>I have a valid understandable exception message and a stackTrace that I can take back to my developers to further debug.  My issue with this though, has to do a lot of handling to make this raw message into something I want logging (which is maybe what I have to do, but I would think someone would have something helpful out there) and I have to have extra code checking the same status again to verify that ""hey, your call failed"".  I would expect an easier <code>.ifFailed(/do stuff here/)</code> or something. If there is something obvious I missed, I apologize. I tried to Google ""Jasmine error handling"" without much success. </p>

<p>I had a detailed discussion and research on this but I'm unable to come to a good tool or a process on how to measure this. Is this something we can do as a part of load testing [which can be done via <a href=""https://github.com/maciejzaleski/JMeter-WebSocketSampler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jmeter's WebSocket plugin</a> . ] or is this something that we should check on a network and packet level. </p>

The challenge is that the report only updates once per day at any point in time between 12AM and 8AM, so in the worst case I need to wait up to 8 hours from the time I create the data before it shows up on the report.</p>

<p>The options I see are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schedule the test to run just before 12AM and let it run for up to 8 hours polling the report for the data. This is the most straightforward approach but it doesn't fit in well with our CI framework which is geared towards short jobs. I'll need to override a couple timeouts just to make this one work, and I'm not totally comfortable with it because it is such a long period of time for a single process to run a test.</li>
<li>Run the test in two distinct steps. Step 1 completes after the data is created. Step 2 runs at 8AM and verifies the data from Step 1 appeared. This seems reasonable to me but it will now require my test process to manage durable state. I can imagine several ways to achieve this (a durable queue, file, etc) but they all introduce significant complexity. Do I just need to accept that complexity and store state for tests of this sort? What are some best practices or libraries that tend to be used for this?</li>

Same error. According to MSDN: <code>x[1]/y[2]</code> means: The second <code>&lt;y&gt;</code> child of the first <code>&lt;x&gt;</code>. And considering <code>chapterxx</code> element shows up once under each <code>reader__xx</code> element ... </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>For example, the below will work:</p>

<p>However, putting a 'FindElement' inside of the wait.Until() defeats the purpose of the wait.Until() ... the below code is bad</p>

<pre><code>Wait.Until(elementA.FindElement(By.Xpath(.//div)));

<p>The wait will no longer occur because the FindElement is inside the wait and inner most nested code gets executed first. So how do you do this? At first I thought I could get the xpath of the ElementA and then append that to the front of the relative XPath (which probably slows down everything) but backing out an XPath from an IWebElement as shown below doesn't seem to be very reliable.  </p>

"149","1","3082","","2011-05-04 14:57:49","","140","10115","<p>I'm a Java developer by trade. I was 'brought-up' in what you could call best practices. Then I took my current job. I had a choice between the Java/SOA team, and the ERP team. I was told that joining the ERP team would give me the best insight into how the business operates (not in terms of technology, but in terms of business.) So I went with ERP.</p>

<p>I found a system with over 4 million lines of ""Progress 4GL"" code (since renamed to Openedge ABL, because ""4GLs sound bad"") code, spread out around about 11000 files. The best part is, no file exists more than one folder down. So you have about 50 folders, each with 300-400 files a piece in them. Luckily, many of the files haven't been touched in over 7 years, and many of them are deprecated (but we don't delete them from version control ""just in case."" Don't even get me started on that one.) So there's really only about 1.5 million lines of code we'd actually have to test. ""Only.""</p>

<p>I could go on and on about the poor practices of the system. The bottom line was for years, developers had no option to say no. It was ""gimme gimme gimme,"" combined with a lot of contractors moving in and out. Now, they want to clean up their act.</p>

<p>One of the first things I suggested was testing. They said, basically ""we've been wanting to do testing for years, but we don't really know where to start."" The business logic and database access are baked into the UI. (I'd say GUI, but it's not graphical, it's on a mainframe. Even the order-entry people telnet in.)</p>

<p>So this is pretty much a worst case scenario. Millions of lines of code. Over a billion dollars in annual sales running through the system, so it's not going to get a re-write (obviously ""it works as it is."") No object orientation. No formal or automated tests. Our testers are also the ones who write the specs (which biases them toward ""pushing the project through."")</p>

<p>I'm getting pretty desperate. I'm even willing to write whatever testing frameworks (there isn't much for Openedge in open source frameworks) we need on my spare time. I'm convinced it will pay for itself quite quickly. <strong>Where can we start? Has anyone here come across a similar project (even if smaller in scale) and if so, how did you cope with and overcome this?</strong></p>

<p>Update: I've had a chat with my manager, and I have approval to draw up a spec/timeline for creating a test harness. At first, I heard this: ""What we really need to do is write some tests."" to which I responded ""Having tests won't really help us if we don't have a way to run them. I've been looking into ProUnit (the old name for OEUnit) and think it will work for us."" ""We should write some tests using it."" It took about 10 minutes of repeating this for him to realize it was not as simple as downloading the library and ""using it."" But, approval to write a spec to create a test harness is a start! Thanks guys for all your input!</p>

Since you cannot change the whole company, you focus on what you and your fellow developers can do to enhance the quality of the applications you create/maintain. You decide that this can best be done by embracing TDD for class verification and BDD for integration testing.</p>

<p>Since we are talking about .NET development here, let's be specific and use:</p>

<ul>
<li>MSTEST as a unit testing framework for the TDD<br>
As a development house you already use TFS 2010 so the MSTEST solution is a given with its integration of code coverage and test pass validation at check-in.  </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.specflow.org"" rel=""nofollow"">SpecFlow</a> for the BDD<br>
SpecFlow is more subjective, but I propose it as a BDD tool as it integrates well with VS 2010 and source control, and the gherkin/cucumber syntax is, I think, easier than that of <a href=""http://fitnesse.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Fitnesse</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving from ""coding with ad hoc testing, followed by a release to QA"" to a ""TDD/BDD"" approach will save time and money over the life of an application—<strong>but</strong>, it will extend the time a program spends <em>in development</em> over the ad hoc approach (although arguably the QA time should reduce as QA should then mostly find system test faults rather than those <em>and</em> integration and class bugs devs now find and fix sooner).  </p>

<p>Assume some minor TDD/BDD projects have already been completed so your company is not overly nervous about the technology, but have yet to ""go for it"" with a full size project. </p>

<p>But in this business, development is a different cost centre from QA, and both are different from support and operations.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do you sell the benefit to the company of adopting TDD/BDD to development managers who are held to account for the increased cost (i.e., time) of the development department?</strong>  </p>

<p>This, to me, is all the harder given the benefits of failing early, etc. seem largely unquantifiable.</p>

<p>How do you go about winning hearts and minds on the topic?</p>

(Think the guy from Office Space, except these guys actually provide some value. Kind of.) Because they have an agenda (keeping the people who gave them the requirements happy) they are often lacking in the thoroughness of the testing they do. Sometimes it's because they simply hadn't considered one portion, but sometimes it's where they actively ignore an area because they know if they test it, it will break, or if they test it they wouldn't know right or wrong either way.</p>

<p>The kicker is, a month from now, I might get a spec that fixes ""a bug introduced with project 12345."" Well, gosh, I sure did a lot of testing on that, obviously I missed some of it. Now, the development team is the one who takes the flak because they're the one who introduced the bug. I for one am willing to admit I don't write perfect code, and so are people on my team. But how do you deal with a (biased) testing group that 1) doesn't communicate with other testers, and 2) refuses to accept the fact they also missed it in their testing?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is a highly un-idealistic environment. There are some of us who have had it quite good in the past, and would like to bring our department up to speed on best practices. It's a slow process, and sometimes we're not sure even where to start.</p>

These tests are written partly in the spirit of Unit tests, that is they try their best to leave the application in the same state in which they found it. For instance, if a test registers a support ticket using the web UI, it is expected to remove it and the end of the test using the web UI.</p>

<p>Compared to unit tests, these kinds of tests do much more, not in terms of actual code executed or processes triggered, but in terms of tested actions. One such hypothetical test would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Actor 1) register support ticket;</li>
<li>(Actor 1) comment with initial data;</li>
<li>(Actor 2) reply with request for more information</li>
<li>(Actor 1) upload more information</li>

<pre><code>Given a standard party
And a flight from ""UK"" to ""Europe""
When I search
And I receive search results
Then I can book my holiday
</code></pre>

<p>In Step Two's Step Definition, I query a database using JDBI and receive a dataset that I can iterate over and use as search data for Step 3 in the API I am sending requests to.  It's is quite common not to receive any results on the first 2 or 3 rows queried.  This is not useful to me because the scenario is not really testing for whether results are returned (although that is clearly a valid scenario).</p>

<p>What I really want is to get results back and then assert that I can book - within that Step Def are checked for correct price etc....</p>

<p>So, if </p>

<pre><code>And I receive search results
</code></pre>

<p>equates to false, how can I return to </p>

<pre><code>And a flight from.....
</code></pre>

<p>...so that I can try the next row of data. </p>

<p>My query then is in the context of Cucumber Step Definitions, what it is the best/ idiomatic way to do this, given that the for each loop is in the earlier step?  </p>

<p>Without exposing too much of the Step Def code, is there a common convention for retrying in such cases?  I can't simply call the underlying search method again because I have many search Step Def methods all glued to steps and the ""And I receive..."" in which I receive a response object has no concept of the preceding Step. </p>

<p>I've been using RestSharp/C# to create my API tests which I've found really useful, however I'm struggling to understand how I'd create a test like the above where I'd want to test multiple API's as part of the one test so that I can ensure the creation and deletion works as expected. For example, I'd pass the Name as a parameter from the ""create employee"" API and ensure it is returned in the GET request.</p>

<p>If anyone has any advice or working examples of this, it would be very useful</p>

"35724","1","","","2018-09-20 15:05:13","","0","156","<p>So here's the setup, we have tests where we fetch test data from excel sheet and iterate over all the rows within a particular test. So, for example, there are tests that create some user profiles, once they do; there's a success message that appears on the next page, our test uses the ""findElement.."" method to capture that element and get's the text to verify that 1) it appears and 2) that the message is correct. Now here's the problem, since the test may iterate over and over a lot (because of excel data rows), every so often we notice that the test throws <code>NoSuchElementException</code> while looking for that success message. I was recently told by someone that instantiating that page object class at each iteration would solve this issue. So my main question really is that would instantiating the page object class solve this, or is there something else I'm missing? Following is a sample of the code (not exact code of course)</p>

<pre><code>    SuccessPage successPage = new SuccessPage(driver);
    InputPage inputPage = new InputPage(driver);
    String successMessage = """";
    excelSheetData = someCustomMethodThatFetchesDataFromExcel();
    for (Map&lt;String, String&gt; rows : excelsheetData){
      inputPage.inputElement1.sendKeys(rows.get(""columnName1""));
      inputPage.inputElement2.sendKeys(rows.get(""columnName2""));
      inputPage.buttonElement.click();
      wait.until(ExpectedConditions(visibilityOf(successPage.successEle)));
      successMessage = successPage.successEle.getText();
      Assert.assertEquals(expectedSuccessMessage, successMessage);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Page object file look something like this</p>

<pre><code>    public class SuccessPage {
    WebDriver driver;
       public SuccessPage(WebDriver driver){
          this.driver = driver;
       }
    @FindBy(""someLogicalName"")
    public WebElement someElement;
</code></pre>

<p>So roughly about 8 out of 10 times the above code works correctly, but those two other times it throws that NoSuchElementException at <code>successMessage = successEle.getText();</code>
What I've been told I should do instead is something like the following</p>

<pre><code>    SuccessPage successPage;
    for(....
      ...
      //create a wrapper clickSubmitBtn() method that returns the page object.
      successPage = inputPage.clickSubmitBtn(driver); //this will instantiate the page object.
      successMessage = successpage.successEle.getText();
      ... }
</code></pre>

<p>So,</p>

<ol>
<li>will this really solve the problem?</li>
<li>is that a good programming practice, should instantiation be done
once before the loop?</li>
</ol>

<p>On both the front and back end, you would typically mock all the network requests and responses. For example on the front end we might click a button that is used to create a new widget which sends the request to the back end which creates the widget and returns a response containing the new widget.</p>

<p>In the above scenario we would create our initial unit tests by mocking the actual network requests and just specifying the data that we want sent / received. Everything passes,…great.</p>

<p>Then we change something on the backend and will change the backend unit tests accordingly. Once again all our unit tests pass. But the problem is that now our front end tests continue passing even though the back end has changed.</p>

<p><code>coverage.py</code> has a new feature to <em>track what and how many tests called a specific line in the code</em>. A potential suggested use case for this feature is to look for the lines in the code that have been executed ""thousands"" of times during a test run indicating that these lines were over-tested and there is a potential to cut down on the number of tests - with a motivation to make a test run faster.</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused as I cannot imagine myself deleting tests because of the over-covering specific lines in the application code. Are there any other potential problems of <em>over-testing</em>?</p>

"24784","1","24786","","2017-01-09 02:46:42","","2","5976","<p>I am developing a testing framework for an application at my work and am running in to an issue. I use Selenium 3.0.1, NUnit 3.5.0, NUnit3TestAdapter 3.6.0, and a Selenium Grid instance to run my tests. In order to parallellize my tests properly I instantiate my webdriver instance at the start of each test (in the test itself, not in a setup method). I do this so that if multiple tests try to execute at the same time they are not trying to talk to the same static webdriver. </p>

<p>I am running in to an issue that when an Assert.IsTrue fails the Driver.Close() method (a wrapper for my driver instance close routine which executes the .Close() method on its own) directly after it does not execute because my code never makes it this far. I understand that this is because the the failing assertion causes the compiler to exit code execution and return a failing test. </p>

<p>My issue with this is that when my Driver.Close() method does not close sessions end up hanging on my grid nodes making them unable to effectively execute the next test in line. If I were using a static driver that I could simply pass around I would just execute the Driver.Close() routine in a teardown method however as I am instantiating my drivers at the start of each test this is not possible. </p>

<p>Does anyone have a way that given the constraints of my environment I can still kill the browser session on my grid node after an assertion fails on a test (perhaps some arcane way that I am unaware of to pass my instantiated RemoteDriver to a teardown method at the end of each test)?</p>

<p>My code is shown below for clarity:</p>

<p>An example of a test:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]

public void GoToSearchPage()
{
    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object
    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver(""firefox"", ""WINDOWS"", ""Hub_Location"");

    // Go to the search page
    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);

    // Verify that the browser is at the search page
    Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), ""The web browser is not at the default search page"");

    // Close the session
    remoteDriver.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>An example of my driver.Close method that lives inside the RemoteDriver class:</p>

<pre><code>public void Close()
{
    // Close the currently open browser and dispose of the currently open instance
    Instance.Close();
    Instance.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Edit</em></strong></p>

<p>Below is the code implementation of the answer provided by ernie</p>

<pre><code>public void GoToSearchPage()
{
    // Create an instance of the RemoteDriver object
    RemoteDriver remoteDriver = new RemoteDriver(""chrome"", ""WINDOWS"", ""HUB_LOCATION"");

    // Go to the search page
    SearchPage.GoTo(remoteDriver);
    try
    {
        // Verify that the browser is at the search page
        Assert.IsTrue(SearchPage.IsAt(remoteDriver), ""The web browser is not at the default search page"");
    }
    catch(AssertionException)
    {
        // Close the currently open browser session
        remoteDriver.Close();

        //Fail the test
        Assert.Fail(""The web browser is not at the default search page"");
    }

    // Close the currently open browser session
    remoteDriver.Close();

}
</code></pre>

<p>While this solution does introduce some slowness (approximately 2-3 seconds if the catch is activated) this allows me to avoid refactoring the way I implement my driver in order to use a setup or teardown method.</p>

<p>Should we employ End-To-End testing or Component style testing? Or both ( and if the latter how do we deal with stuff coming out of test doubles) </p>

<p>Given a REST API, which creates commands, to be consumed asynchronously, and a messaging endpoint performing some action based on a command, which all reside in the same Microservice.  To my mind, the boundaries are at the input into the REST api and the output of the messaging endpoint.  </p>

<p>From a Microservice perspective, I can push in a request and get a message out of the back (mocking interactions with nearest neighbours) to get me to an end state in an End to End style test, and have done so.  The drawback with this though is we start to create an hour glass instead of a  testing triangle, If I am to ATDD all features like this. Which is a fair criticism</p>

<p>A bit of a debate has arisen about not exercising expensive HTTP calls, and messaging or Databases (which is all fair enough), more an End to End style of testing (favoured in GOOS for example) but rather using Component style testing but then this would omit the messaging aspect unless a test double for the messaging was pretty clever.) </p>

<p>We knew:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each component worked.</li>
<li>User tests passed</li>
<li>The system worked fine on day 0</li>

<p>But not:</p>

<ul>
<li>On day x after creation of items a rule would kick in that caused some items to fail.</li>

<p>We had specific tests for the rule, however we did not catch that it would apply to the items we were creating. These were a new type of item which the rule should not apply to. </p>

<p>So in tests everything was fine, and looked fine on production but after some time some users had problems.</p>

<p>This would seem a difficult thing to catch before hand. Now I have some tests in place that age the transaction and test that the logic is applied correctly we can stop regressions. But we endeavour to find bugs before production.  </p>

<li>Is HP LeanFT more a DevTester Tool?</li>
<li>What level of Programming skills needed to use the Tool (can the testers use it, or need to have very good developing skills?)</li>
<li>Did not found any online resource to start with using LeanFT in Visual Studio for C#? can anyone share if available?</li>

Think 20 excel sheets. Page 1 50rows, page 2 100 rows, etc.. each row contains link and some data, and i want to find and make a list of all those links. So i go to page 1, get all links, move on to page 2, page 3, then when im at page which contains lots of rows, it (test) freezes, page stays open forever and there are no errors.</p>

<p>Im pretty sure problem is with FindElements() since this method i use to get links from each sheet/page and it works for ones with fewer elements:</p>

<pre><code>        List&lt;IWebElement&gt; _links = new List&lt;IWebElement&gt;();

        List&lt;string&gt; links = new List&lt;string&gt;();

        links = d.FindElements(By.PartialLinkText(partialLink)).ToList();

        int i = 0;

        foreach (IWebElement element in _links)
        {           
            links.Add(_sellerLinks[i].Get_Attribute(""href""));
            i++;
        }

<p>It works flawlessly when there are 10-40 rows, sometimes fail at 70 rows, and can never get past 'sheet' with 400 rows. If there was problem with code it would fail sooner i think.</p>

  ever it is necessary.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Test Data</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Test data should be separate from the rest of the automation code. The
  reason is this: if you do not separate your test data, as you add new
  tests you will duplicate field identifiers and the data to enter. When
  there is a change to the code, you will have a maintenance nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, if your test data is in a separate, non-compiled format, it's a lot easier for other people to add new tests. If the data format for each type of test is clearly defined, all that's needed to add an iteration of a test is to edit a text file and add a new row of data.</p>

I am planning to write an automated tests for the UI using selenium web drivers in the py.test. I would like to know what is the best architecture (not the code) for designing the whole automation. The structure I am considering is </p>

<p>Framework level - contains modules for getting the page object, and functions like getItem, logout, login,logging, exceptions, startbrowser, getClickableObject, sendkeysandenter, generate report, waitforresponse, getting and releasing testbeds, loading the webdriver, Global test properties connections or any other generic functions etc</p>

<p>Tests - get the page object, get the item by id, click,sendkeys,verify etc. Basically I want developing the tests to be as simple as possible and anyone can get aboard and write the tests without needing to know the details of implemenation.</p>

<p>Is this a good way for long term maintenance and ease of writing? Any other suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>Additionally, two more questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I have to store all the pages (something like page map) statically somewhere to verify the pages are loaded correctly. For example, an enter loads a particular page. My main concern with this way is what if the resultant page change? Does the corresponding test cases have to rewritten again?</li>
<li>Any action in the UI sends a command to a particular device and changes it properties. The device has a Rest API which returns its properties and this can be used if the changes in the UI is reflected on the device.  Ideally, it would be better if this comparison is made for every test. If this might cause too much overhead, this can be made optional. Any better way to carry on this particular aspect?</li>

"29898","1","29900","","2017-10-02 11:32:25","","3","1635","<p>I have recently started developing an automated test suite for one of my company's products, which has been written in AngularJS, using <a href=""http://www.protractortest.org/#/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protractor</a> as the testing framework (although I have used JavaScript quite a lot in the past, I am new to AngularJS, and have never previously worked on anything that has involved automated testing).</p>

<p>Having decided to design &amp; write the tests in as 'modular' a way as possible, i.e. grouping the tests that are testing similar features/ related elements of the application together, I have started with writing some simple scripts to test the app navigation.</p>

<p>While this has started well, and all of my tests for the first few navigation buttons &amp; pages pass correctly, I ran into an issue when testing the navigation to one particular page: the 'Charts' page.</p>

<p>The issue that I ran into here, is that as soon as the user browses to this page, there is a <code>service</code> running within the app that automatically opens up a dialog to give the user options for creating/ editing a chart. Because this dialog 'overlays'/ sits on top of the actual page, all of the menu buttons are disabled while the dialog is open, so my test script currently fails, as it can't find the menu button to return to the page that it navigated from.</p>

<p>To solve this, I want to add a few lines to my test script, that will find the dialog's 'Cancel' button, &amp; click it, before continuing with the rest of the script, but due to how the dialog service has been written, the 'Cancel' button (&amp; other elements belonging to the dialog) don't have <code>id</code> attributes that I would usually use to get hold of them (i.e. doing something like <code>var dialogCancelBtn = element(by.id('cancelBtn'));</code>).</p>

<p>There is a <code>DialogMgr</code> service written within the application, which has a <code>closeAll()</code> function that would be useful to call in order to close the dialog, so that the test can continue to run. </p>

<p>The <code>DialogMgr</code> has been defined with:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('app.dlg')
// The service provides dialog windows based on the bootstrap Modal service
.factory('DialogMgr', function ($rootScope, $document, dialogs) {

// A list of active instances of dialogs
var dlgs = [];

// Variable to store the loading dialogue
var loadingDlg;

...
    // Function to dismiss and remove the dialog from the manager
    function closeDlg(dlg) {
        // If the dialog is defined
        if (angular.isDefined(dlg)) {
            // Fetch the index from the dialogues
            var index = dlgs.indexOf(dlg);

            // Remove the dialogues
            dlgs.splice(index, 1);

            // Dismiss the dialogue
            dlg.dismiss();
        }
    }
    ...
    return dialog_manager;
});
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm not sure about is how I 'get hold' of this service from within Protractor. The service is obviously not an HTML element, so I can't do something like <code>dialogService = element(by.id(...));</code>... </p>

<p>How would I get hold of the service in order to use its functions within my test script?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The HTML for the dialog appears to have been written so that it can be used for a number of different dialogs, and not just for this form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""modal-header dialog-header-confirm""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div ng-form=""chartConfigForm"" class=""ui-tab-container ui-tab-vertical""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""modal-footer""&gt;
    ...
    &lt;button class=""btn btn-default""
            type=""button""
            ng-click=""cancel()""&gt;

        &lt;span class=""ti-na hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<p>This being said, i'd typically use poltergeist to run headless because it works well...but at the same time phantomjs will probably eventually lose out to headless chrome, and not to mention a lot of the issues we've seen with this particular app have been browser related.</p>

"39894","1","","","2019-07-09 00:21:45","","8","375","<p>I have a Junior QA interview coming up, and I was asked to learn the basics of Selenium. I have done this through free tutorials. I am fine with the Selenium concepts, but I was told I would be asked how I would test real-world objects at a conceptual level. I may be asked to test any random object in the world but it will probably be a simple one - bicycle, can opener, etc. I will not have to write code but explain it orally. I am not sure how to approach studying for this and how I should relate it to Selenium testing with Java. I can't find any resources that are similar to this, so I am asking here to be pointed in the right direction, or for a conceptual example for a real-world object.</p>

<p>The person in HR didn't really give me much info other than that I would be asked to explain how I would test real world objects without writing any code.</p>

<p>For example, let's say I'm asked how I would test a bicycle. The way I would answer this now not knowing what they're really looking for is this:</p>

<p>I would ask what the function of the bicycle is and how the various parts work together to achieve this functionality. I would deduce that the bicycle has 3 primary functions; be driven by a drive train through the rotation of the peddles by the user, and a braking mechanism operated by the user, and the swivel of the front wheel to turn.</p>

<p>Now that I have determined the primary functionality I would break these down into smaller problems to test. For the sake of this post, I will just go into the drive train. I would determine when the user pedals it will turn the chaining which it would pull the chain forward. This chain is connected to a chaining on the rear wheel which turns the wheel through the transfer of energy given from the chain. I would then ask is this the only way the user can use the bicycle? Is pedaling the only function that the client has access to? If, so I would test to make sure this function properly catches any invalid input or uses.</p>

<p>I would need to test each individual piece so as to build a larger test. I  would check to see how the Pedal class calls the Chaining class. How do they interact? What would happen if I passed the argument ""pedal_backwards"" to the chaining? What kind of constraints with pedaling does the Chaining enforce? Next, I would check to see how the Chaining calls the Chain class. What constraints are there in this invocation? I would do the same for the rear chaining.</p>

<p>Basically I would break the object down into smaller problems and test how they interact with each other. This way changes to the code base will still be testable with my tests and will continue to work autonomously.</p>

<p>Am I on the right track? I wasn't really given much information just that an engineer would pick a real-world object and ask me to test it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<li>Why is having skills to use a debugger important?</li>
<li>What should a (test) developer minimal know about using debugger?</li>

I know that I can copy the prints to a specific folder that follows the scenario name and that works great, but I was wishing I could separate the logs during the execution too, so I could use them as evidence, it often can hold valuable information.</p>

<p>I know the importance of reports varies between different organizations and clients. As far as my organization is concerned, my hands are pretty much free.

"35815","1","35855","","2018-09-27 07:58:07","","4","251","<p>Before asking the actual question, let me describe the current situation.</p>

<p>The IT department consists of a few Scrum-like teams, with <strong>one or two software testers per team</strong>.
Furthermore there are two overarching roles not bound to a team: the <strong>QA team lead</strong>, and a <strong>test automation expert</strong>.</p>

<p>The test automation expert has achieved the following in about 18 months:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a framework to write API tests</li>
<li>Create a framework to write UI tests</li>
<li>Create a framework to set up data (using SQL and events) for automated tests</li>
<li>Create a tool to collect and store results from all test runs</li>
<li>Over 2500 API tests have been written (including by the other testers)</li>
<li>Over 120 UI tests have been written</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Training of the team members is ongoing (basic coding skills to writing automated tests).</li>
<li>Tests are integrated in CI pipelines by the team lead and architectural team.</li>
<li>Maintenance of API tests is a responsibility being pushed to the teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the above, the current 'test automation' work is now <strong>limited</strong> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintenance of frameworks and tests (but that's decreasing)</li>
<li>training/coaching (limited in time of course)</li>
<li>writing additional API/UI tests on new features for the teams</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<p>Is there a next level of challenges for this role - beyond the frameworks? And beyond simply adding more tests? <strong>In what other ways can the role support the QA process?</strong></p>

<p>One idea was exploring AI test automation but that is quite a different beast. Especially because the ROI - for in-house tools - seems hard to defend.</p>

<p><strong>Additional edit</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The tests are run in pipelines (each team has at least one pipeline, and there are pipelines for consolidated Dev/Release branches). Especially for releases, tests provide a quick feedback and are fairly consistently at about 98,5% passing rate.</li>
<li>Test data management: currently, some pipelines deploy to both a ""manual testing environment"" having a full restored database, and and ""automated testing environment"" having an empty database. This database is first of all prefilled with fixed core data (specific scripts). Furthermore <strong>every test is self-sufficient</strong> in that it prepares its own customers, contracts etc.</li>

"35840","1","","","2018-09-28 09:28:36","","0","75","<p>I am using Cucumber through IntelliJ and am working on fixing a broken test. I was wondering when debugging, is there a way to save the state of the system up to a certain step in the feature file, if they all pass. For example, take this exaggerated example below</p>

<pre><code>   Given I am a New User
   And There is an Event on a certain date
   When I log in
   And Go to the Events page
   And I select the Event
   And I go to the Payments Page
   And I attempt to pay with credit card
   (cont)
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, if I am checking why credit card payments were failing in the test, I'd have to rerun the test loads of times to get the system into the state I wanted it in (user, event created). Is there a way to save the state of the system once a step passes? So, therefore, running the test above and it failing on the last step, means that if I run it again it will restore the state of the system based on a snapshot of how it was after the last step and continue to run from the next step. Example...</p>

<pre><code>   Given I am a New User
   (snapshot of the system with a new user is recorded)
   And There is an Event on a certain date
   (snapshot of the system with a new user and event is recorded)
   When I log in
   (snapshot of the system with a new user and event is recorded and the user is logged in)
</code></pre>

<p>I worked in a place that used an in-house test runner and they were able to do it, just wondering if this is a feature that is available?</p>

We are writing functional tests (dozens, in future few hundred of kbytes of high level language code) and don't actually mess with original software code -- we test the executable. The question is about managing the tests on at leasts two branches.</p>

<p>The software consists of several components. Some of them are parallel and their updates influe only 5% of our tests code. Some are perpendicular and touch everything. The perpendicular component change is solvable via versioning the abstract communication layers.  </p>

<p>My idea is:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a universal wrapper, which recognizes the version of software and:
<ul>
<li>in case of component's big change the wrapper runs another tests file</li>
<li>in case of tests set change the <code>skipIf Version &gt;/&lt;/==/...</code> decorators work for us</li>
</ul></li>
<li>remove outdated tests time to time according to Skip details</li>
<li>have a single branch (trunk) in a repository</li>
</ul>

<p>But my collegue says:</p>

<ul>
<li>branch the tests</li>
<li>time to time put one branch over another, throwing away the Stable one</li>
<li><em>""we don't need <code>if</code>s - they make code too complex""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So while we are developing several (at least Dev and Beta) branches at the same time, we would mess with folders and do copypaste. And what's wrong with <code>if</code>? I thought they are ok in programming...</p>

I feel this is  redundant because that data is already being pulled by the application and is displayed correctly (or incorrectly) in the application. Wouldn't any data inconsistencies expose themselves in the application itself?</p>

<p>This is the jist of the issue, but I will provide a simplified test case to expand on what I'm talking about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Go to user ""John Smith"" profile and update his phone number from ""(999) 999-9999"" to ""(666) 666-6666"" and click the save button in the application</li>
  <li>Verify application displays ""Successfully changed user profile""</li>
  <li>Go to preview profile and verify John Smith's profile reflects the changes</li>
  <li>Verify table USER_PROFILE in DBusers database updated with changes</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it necessary to check the table in the database if we've already verified the application is displaying the data correctly? The application is ALREADY pulling the data from the database table, so obviously if the application is displaying the data correctly then the data in the database is correct. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Thanks for your input.</p>

<p><em><strong>More info:</strong> To me, it seems that the only practical purpose for verifying a database directly (for our circumstances) would be to verify that any data replication is successful. We have web and console based apps that use separate DBMSs. The two we use are SQL Server and DB2. After specific data is added to SQL Server, a job runs that replicates it to DB2. They have different structures, so the tables / fields are all different between the two. I can understand verifying this replication has performed successfully.</em></p>

Let's say we have a system that qualifies whether an employee deserves for promotion or not and want to test it.</p>

<p>The system recognizes such candidates for promotion by counting how many hours in a row a user did overtime, how many commitments it completed. It does not operates on statistics, but do calculate them themselves based on the work registered by the user.</p>

<p>I could set data for test in a very precise way:</p>

<pre><code>createUser()
  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY).from(16).to(20))
  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY).from(10).to(15))
  .with(overtime().on(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY).from(14).to(19))
  .with(commitment().plannedFor(days(5)).completedIn(days(1))
  .with(commitment().plannedFor(days(1)).completedIn(days(3));
</code></pre>

<p>But I could also define a specification for the test data that is more concise </p>

<pre><code>createUser()
 .with(overtime().of(hours(13).including(weekends()))
 .with(commitments().completedBeforeDeadline(0.5))
</code></pre>

<p>and is used by the test framework to generate actual data for the tests.</p>

<p>Having this kind of abstraction in the test (only a few most important variables), I am immediately able to grasp the idea of test. Also, I can write much more combinations of test in a short time.</p>

<p>I know we haven't invented a wheel, so I would like to read more about this approach, its risks etc but don't know how to search for it. How do you call it? Is it somehow related to BDD? Or what?</p>

<p>Our proposal has been refused by Joe. The reason was that code is still changing and every code change could possibly break test scripts and require them to be updated. Joe explained that load tests should happen after code freeze, preferably after everything is already approved by the business. It was also refused by head of QA for the same reasons.</p>

<p>I usually include URLs, HTTP requests and responses (whole, or only header or body with JSON). So I wonder if cURL and HAR are better than that and if so, then how. Particularly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does it make sense to attach them to a bug report? In what problems they can be useful?</li>
<li>How cURL command is better from simple URL or JSON request to reproduce the issue? Did cURL help you isolate any defect or understand the problem better than HTTP Request? It seems to me to be the same, just sending a request from command line seems more straightforward. </li>
<li>Is HAR file useful only to understand performance problems? If so, then how? If no, then also how?</li>

<p>So, my question is: Why use the inputs '2' and '99'? I tried to make a program with a fault such that the test case set (0, 1, 2, 99, 100 and 101) exposes a failure and the test case set (0, 1, 100, 101) does not expose it, but I can't make such program.</p>

<p>Could you make such program? If not, it is a waste of resources to create redundant test cases '2' and '99'.</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to application</li>
<li>Navigate to the Search Page</li>
<li>Open Create New Page</li>
<li>Enter Data and Save record (at this point an entry is created in Database too)</li>
</ol>

<p>I have added Validation Rule (Finding Username, which is displayed on page header once record save operation is completes) in this test, just to make sure that record is saved and web test is working fine, all the test data (like Name, Address etc.) is coming from CSV file. Now, when I run this test it executes well and assertion (Find Username) works fine. Entry is there in Database too.</p>

<p>Now, I have created a load test in VSTS Ultimate which is using this web test and specified the user load as 5 with constant load pattern and Iteration count as 1, this test case still creates only 1 entry in Database while I have 5 rows with different dataset in CSV file. But if I increase the number of Iterations from 1 to 5, then it creates 5 records; which is a bit confusing. Why VSTS Ultimate is not creating 5 records with constant load as 5, why it is creating only 1 record for 5 user load.</p>

<p>First I thought that application might not be able to handle 2 concurrent user load but if that had been the case then I should get Assertion Failed error or some other error which is not there.</p>

<p><strong>What could be the possible reason for this behavior of load pattern? Do I need to change anything or I'm missing something in my tests?</strong> </p>

<p>The source mentioned above says there are techniques, of which the <code>cause-effect</code> or <code>root-effect</code>, the <code>equivalent partitioning</code> and the <code>boundary value analysis</code> are three.</p>

<p>How can a software tester without any knowledge of the program do these tests? To partition it right, I guess you should have knowledge about the program, which especially seems to be the case in the <code>cause-effect</code> technique. Am I misunderstanding some definitions?

"39950","1","","","2019-07-11 12:36:03","","0","64","<p>We have several Angular applications (Micro UIs) and they are all 100% covered by our UATs (User Acceptance Tests) written with Protractor (Angular Test Framework based on Selenium).</p>

<p>There are several problems with this approach, although this is probably the best and suggested way for Angular Testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time consuming... Do not understand me wrong. These tests are super handy, whenever we make a change, we let these run (these are actually integrated in our CI/CD Pipelines) and be sure that the app works still as we want. But still, even if we test a use case at least 1 time manually anyway, this has to be also written in Protractor/Jasmine. And takes time..</li>
<li>These Tests are very dependant on HTML Structure. Some locators find the html elements with xpaths (very bad), some with id etc. but at the end, any change in HTML, would somehow cause a change in our tests.. although the change does not change anything on UI for the end user.</li>
<li>The whole CSS is ignored. Like the typical Selenium Tests, all tests run against the DOM, and except tests which checks the hidden/shown fields, over 90% of our CSS is ignored.. if one day, a single line which never supposed to be shown in 2 lines shown, really is shown in 2 lines, we will not know that automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine a test framework like this: you open your app on browser, and start the keyboard/mouse capture tool of your test framework. Then you start testing a scenario on your app in your browser, for example you move your mouse on a specific location, you click on a button, you choose a value from a dropdown, a redirect occurs, and at the end you look on your screen and see if the desired X text is shown on the right side.</p>

<p>The only thing which the capture tool cannot know is what you really checked (X text on the right side). For this you take a screenshot of this area, and put in your test framework.</p>

<p>These mouse/keyboard captures will then be replayed while testing on the Pipeline and the checks/asserts are done against these screenshots.. even with some pixel offset maybe, if you do not want your tests fail in case of tiny css changes.</p>

<p><strong>Would it be usefull at all? Do you know some frameworks like this? Specially which we may use for our Angular apps? Do you think this approch is better regarding time and quality?</strong></p>

<p>The benefits would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since you just let your capturing tool run while you are manually testing your app just after you finish your implementation, and make some screenshots and put them in framework somehow, tests would not consume so much time like writing code for UATs.</li>
<li>They would mostly run independent of HTML Structure. So as long as our button is located on its location and on its behaviour, it would not bother us if it now has a one more div parent in the DOM.</li>
<li>Our Css would also be tested since we compare pictures.</li>
</ul>

<p>And at the end, this is just what we want, to look on the app and see if it looks right, click and enter some keyboard events and check again if we see what we want. Not like protractor or selenium tests, which just blindly communicate with the DOM.</p>

<p>My current test scenario is about designing a test staging environment that is addressed via an API gateway. We chose WSO2. They already have corresponding test frameworks on board, but I want to go other ways, because we already use acceptance testing via Cucumber and serenity. </p>

<p>Another problem is that several projects are currently being tested in regression. Of course I have to take a look at these projects to change them to the current and agile way.</p>

<p>In my planning I want to do acceptance tests, UI tests and penetration tests in the test environment (but also in the production environment).
For the acceptance test, we currently used serenity in the test environments and, of course, integrated reporting accordingly. </p>

<p>For penetration testing I would use ZAP or a similar tool and want to integrate it into the test environment as well as into the production environment.</p>

<p><strong>Current structure:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Various projects with applications that are still being tested via<br>
regression on the one hand.</li>
<li>Isolated projects tested through serenity and pipelined into
Jenkins  </li>
<li>Currently no penetration test available</li>
<li>Currently no load or performance test available</li>
<li>The test team is currently designed for three testers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Planned structure</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>API Gateway Solution via WSO2</li>
<li>Planned integration of serenity Jenkins pipelines into WSO2 as
acceptance test on test environment</li>
<li>Planned load and performance test on the production environment
(possibly already on the staging environment?)</li>
<li>Planned penetration test on the test environment as well as on the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>queries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Would you rather use your own test frameworks in WSO2? Or should existing test frameworks be connected to WSO2 via Jenkins? </li>
<li>Should integration testing be performed on the staging environment?</li>
<li>What would your test plan look like on an appropriate staging
environment?</li>
<li>Should Load and Performance Testing only be performed on the
production environment?</li>
<li>Should one use the existing penetration test solutions of WSO2 or
rather integrate own solutions?</li>

<p>Complicating things a bit, I'm not working directly with the developers of the system, but rather for one of their customers - which somewhat limits my access to some of the information and expertise I would otherwise expect to have.  The client runs over WCF with a binding to an HTTPS endpoint on Azure.</p>

<p>I have JMeter running on the same box as the client.  I have the JMeter Proxy Server working and the ApacheJMeterTemporaryRootCA.crt in place and working.  The client doesn't have it's own proxy settings, but does appear to be honoring useDefaultWebProxy=""true"" (as indicated by the client failing with SSL security warnings when the temp cert isn't in place).  However, when I exercise the client with the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder running, none of the traffic to and from the client ever shows up in the recorder.  When I use a browser under the same setup, the traffic is getting recorded as expected.</p>

<p>Being able to get the recorder working is vital because I don't have access to enough information about the client's protocols to try building out tests for them manually (and I suspect it may prove outside of my skillset, given my very limited experience with WCF).</p>

<p>Any useful solutions, suggestions, tips, or pointers would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>

<ul>
<li>Design an Architecture of ""Test Automation"" that would include defining proper naming convention, maintaining source code, maintaining version history and control</li>
<li>Selecting Stable Application for Test Automation. And also select the chunk of Test Cases based on priority for Automation.</li>
<li>Creation of robust - scalable framework that includes a set of rules for writing the test scripts, so as to bring the requirement of maintenance to a minimum. Also, the scripts should be written in a way that they have the ability to cope with minor changes in the application without the need for re-writing them.</li>
<li>Identify and assign tasks to Test Automation Engineers with predefined goals and milestones. </li>
</ul>

<p>But yesterday we had a discussion in the team how often we want to test our projects via CI pipeline and vulnerability scanner for issues.</p>

<p>The discussion resulted in a violent exchange of blows.</p>

<ul>
<li>As little scanning as possible. Only once a week would make sense to
integrate the high risk issues into the respective sprint.</li>
<li>Permanent scanning via CI integration. But here the risk was described that one would find possibly too many false positives, which would go beyond any sprint planning. </li>
<li>Possible drop in performance if several pages are scanned at the same time. This scenario is also not impossible and I have experienced it in other projects. Scanning some pages took days.</li>

<ol>
<li><p>Very Simple and straight approach where the testing team uses the same code repo on which dev is working, And we add the API test cases just like the unit test case in Test package of the same repo.
<strong>PROS:</strong> less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc., test cases will be available to the dev team, 
<strong>CONS:</strong> every time we add new test cases, we will have to do a pull request to merge the test cases, test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise there would be compilation failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a separate project with the third-party library, for example, REST ASSURED to automate the APIs testing. Here the testing team will import the dev code and use the DTOs, database access objects from the imported dev code.
<strong>PROS:</strong> less work because the testing team need not create DTOs etc.
<strong>CONS:</strong> test cases will require immediate attention in case of dev code change otherwise test cases will give compilation failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use Dev code at all and write all DTOs and everything and automate the test cases using REST Assured in a separate project.
<strong>PROS:</strong> Not any dependency on DEV code.
<strong>CONS:</strong> The testing team will have to create lots of DTOs for mapping the request and response JSON. This will take too much efforts and time and will be a replication of task which is already done by the dev team.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not create DTOs and use JSON Schema to create DTOs at runtime and use REST ASSURED in a separate project.
<strong>PROS:</strong> No need to create too many DTOs.Test case management and maintenance would be easy.
<strong>CONS:</strong> Not found yet, please suggest what cons could be of this approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Or Any other approach which is better than the above approaches. Kindly suggest.</p></li>

<pre><code>        &lt;Item IsKit=""false""&gt;

<p>...where the code in c# I have written is as below</p>

<pre><code>        XElement items = new XElement(""Items"");
        items.Add(new XElement(""Item IsKit =\""false\""""
</code></pre>

<p>I believe the issue is because there are spaces between the words 'Item' and 'IsKit'....my question is how I would get around this in order for this element to be added to my test code?</p>

<p>What I am trying to work out is the best way of setting up my framework so that in the example of the <code>BillingAddress</code> class I can set up a series of properties e.g. <code>AddressLine1/AddressLine1</code> etc which can then be called when I run the test</p>
<p>Any advice on how to structure the test framework would be most appreciated</p>

<p>I wonder if for finding concurrency issues I should run more focused tests in addition to load tests? Or maybe it is enough to run traditional performance tests? Or maybe I should change something in performance tests so they detect such issues better? E.g., </p>

<ul>
<li>make test scenarios more complex, including more endpoints in one scenario.</li>
<li>run threads with random delays to increase the chance of interesting interleavings between accessing the shared resource.</li>

<p>So, I'd like to ask you to verify my responses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Explain the stages in an application's lifecycle where non-functional tests and architecture based-test tests may be applied.
  Explain the causes of non-functional testing taking place only in
  specific stages of application's lifecycle.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Non-functional tests can be applied in any stage of an application's lifecycle. Some of non-functional characteristic like efficiency depends of quality of a single components. Therefore execution efficiency should be already tested at the unit or integration level.</p>

<p>Some non-functional testing does not have sense until late in the Software Development Life Cycle. It is not possible to measure a characteristic like usability before the product is not integrated into one system. </p>

<p>(I don't understand what does <em>architecture based-test tests</em> mean. Can someone explain this term for me?)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Give examples of the criteria that influence the structure and level of test condition development</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>If you have a marketing requirements document and a system requirements document then you can use the former to generate high-level test conditions and then use the latter to elaborate same low-level test conditions underneath each high-level one.</li>
<li>Quality risk analyst - we can outline the key features and quality characteristics at a high level. These quality risk items are thus the test high-level test conditions</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Describe how test analysis and design are static testing techniques that can be used to discover defects.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The process of test analysis and design needs to precise understanding the requirements specification, design specification, or other documents used as input into process. It allows identify defects in the documentation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>Explain by giving examples the concept of the test oracle and how a test oracle can be used in test specifications</li>

<p>To be honest, I don't understand this exercise. How the test oracle can be used to test a specifications? English is not my native language, it is a problem. </p>

This is where I see the strange problem with the forward slashes. However, when I run the tests <em>directly</em> on the Linux server with its own X-Windows session, the problem goes away.

<ul>
<li>Ramp up 75 users, 2 every 20 seconds </li>
<li>Run for 6 hours </li>
<li>Ramp down 30 users from it simultaneously</li>
<li>Run the 45 users for another 4 hours </li>
<li>Ramp down another 15 users simultaneously</li>
<li>Run for another 2 hours with the users(30) left</li>
<li>Then ramp <strong>up</strong> another 45 users and repeat above steps for next 12 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is wrong with the above strategy?  Should we have run
the test for a lower transaction target but using the same number as
baseline (150) users? </li>
<li>What should be the key metrics we should
be looking for as a part of the endurance test? Where should we be looking for answers? I am not talking
about 'Long Term Application stability' kind of answers. More

<p>Just a simple example is when there is <code>NullPointerException</code> thrown by a method. A bug report contains no steps to reproduce the issue, just a stacktrace. Given such a poor report, a developer corrects the code so the method swallows such exceptions or re-write the method. Then he marks the defect as fixed. </p>

<p>As a tester I usually care more about the context. Why <code>null</code> values arrived to the method? Which component produced it and why? So simply swallowing the exception is not a solution: it probably did't removed the error. Rather it masked it.</p>

<p>This kind of problems usually happens, when someone else reported a bug (not me), for instance a customer representative, and I see the bug report only when verifying the fix.</p>

<p>So it all boils down to the quality of bug report. If steps to reproduce weren't written before fixing the bug, they must be identified after the fix. And then it is often hard to do it, because I need to check-out/setup two system versions from SVN: one before the fix, and another after the fix was committed.</p>

<p>So how can we improve the process?</p>

<ol>
<li>Shouldn't testers and devs complete the bug report with steps to reproduce before fixing it? I don't care who will do it, but I think such a step should be present in the bug lifecycle here.</li>
<li>If devs and testers cannot collect information from customer to reproduce the bug, should they patch it (as in the example above) or reject a bug report as ""cannot reproduce""?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Maybe I wasn't clear enough. I haven't asked how to write a good bug report. I'm rather looking for practical ways to make devs, customer representative, business analysts, me, etc. complete a bug report as it goes through our hands. Some solutions other have proposed so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>introduce templates in bug reports</li>
<li>review good and bad reports with stakeholders to demonstrate how they help or hinder reproducing bugs and fixing them</li>
<li>gently ask customer for more details (talking to a customer seems a separate art to me), particularly for what they did before the failure occurred. </li>
</ul>

<p>Particularly, I haven't seen any answer what a dev should provide in a bug report after fixing the bug? Root cause? What areas were touched? How were they changed? In which revision change was committed?  </p>

"6866","1","6900","","2013-09-24 20:12:45","","14","767","<p><strong>The situation</strong></p>

<p>I need to start building automated regression for a very large web application with thousands of users. It is impossible to start from a known state, or even to be sure that data entered into the application will be saved to a known state. The application is a payroll entry system, where all data is read only if payroll has not been started, and has an insane number of configuration choices.</p>

<p>The application can't be run on a local database with a local setup: it requires multiple interlocking web services (which use - don't ask me why - the system registry to determine where to submit their results) and is not practical to reset (a database refresh can take all day). The test sandbox environment can be accessed by multiple users and configurations changed in ways that completely alter the expected behavior of the system. the development sandbox environment is often out of action for days at a time when large projects are being worked on.</p>

<p><strong>The strategies I see as viable</strong></p>

<p>The potential strategies I'm considering are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Set my initial conditions first</em> - This is - alas - a bit more complex than it looks. I would need to make either several database queries or do a number of screenscrapes to determine whether the company has had its configuration changed, and whether I need to start a payroll run, change the configuration back to what it should be, then submit the false run before starting a clean run with the correct configuration. This would also complicate end-of-test checks because I would then need to find and discard the initial submit file in order to check the validity of the one with the data my tests actually entered. On the plus side, the values saved to the pending transaction tables prior to submit and the contents of the submit file would match expectations.</li>
<li><em>Dynamic checking of results</em> - by this I mean the much more complex coding needed to check results based on which configuration flags are active when I test, regardless of whether they're what I expect to see. The advantages I see here are that I wouldn't need to try to force the system to the settings I was starting with, and I'd be building in an oblique check that certain fields display only when certain configuration flags are enabled. On the flip side, this is a great deal more complicated to code properly, and as a result, much more error-prone.</li>
<li><em>Hybrid approach</em> - where I set certain key values but let the rest do whatever someone else set them to. This would give me some of the disadvantages of each method, but would allow me to limit the extra complexity to areas that tend to be moving targets anyway. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some other considerations</strong></p>

<p>I have (after six months experience with the system) a reasonable grasp of where the system interacts with web services (these are all built and maintained in-house, but tend not to get much development. They also typically get called from the web application or poll the web application database, so testing them separately isn't on the agenda at this stage). The web services are integral to the system to an extent that it's not possible to simply test only the web application. </p>

<p>The application is written is classic ASP. There is no way to separate front end and business logic. It is not unit tested because it is not unit testable. While there is a plan to replace it with a better engineered system, I will be testing this system for at least another 2 years, potentially longer. </p>

<p>Given these ""interesting"" complexities, what approach should I take to building automated regression for this application? </p>

<p><strong>Terminology Update</strong>
In response to @user246 requesting clarification of some of the terminology I used:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>submit the false run</em> - by this I mean to submit a payroll that contains nothing but a change of configuration settings where I don't actually care what gets sent. </li>
<li><em>submit file</em> - This one is a bit more complex. All the calculation logic and check generation logic happens in a back end server I have no access to. My only interface to the back end server is a fixed length format text file: the submit file. This file is generated for every payroll submission, with a defined naming convention. When there is more than one payroll submission in a short timeframe for a given customer, it can be difficult to find the one that contains the information I'm interested in.</li>
<li><em>pending transaction tables</em> - between the start of a payroll run and submitting the run, everything that happens is recorded to one of a number of database tables. They're known as the pending transaction tables because changes to configuration, payroll, and personnel data are not final until everything has been synched between the web application and the back end server. Until a payroll run is submitted, changes aren't permanent, and depending on the logic involved can exist only in the pending transaction tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is of course a general problem and they could got fired for such an attitude. But in reality things aren't as simple as this.</p>

<p>My question now is if there are clever tactics which prevent them from cheating. I would let some random errors occur for each tester to prevent it, but as they are the developers it's nearly impossible to prevent searching the source code for these errors. Another idea would be to offer a reward for the person who found the most bugs. Or don't let multiple people test the same things (but this reduces the quality of the tests).</p>

<p>I am able to login to the page, but unable to logout. The login and logout button themselves are made visible by clicking the loginLogoutElementMakeVisible element seen below. This element changes after logging in. </p>

<p>My current solution is to have one reference to the element in my code as seen below:</p>

<p><code>[Findsby(How = How.CssSelector, Using = ""a[href='javascript:void(0)']"")]
public IWebElement loginLogoutElementMakeVisible</code></p>

<p>Html for the button to make login button visible:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class=""nav-link sm-menu-item more""&gt;
&lt;a data-bind=""click: function(){ loginClicked(true); }, text: translate('menu_login')"" href=""javascript:void(0)""&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Html for the button to make logout button visible:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class=""nav-link sm-menu-item more nav-profile""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""javascript:void(0)""&gt;
        &lt;img data-bind=""attr: { 'src': avatarUrl }"" src=""https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/p/1/000/1c2/3a6/04b3e5c.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""submenu sm-submenu""&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The general concept I have used is to have these two action methods in the page object to login and logout.</p>

<pre><code>public void Login()
{
    loginLogoutElementMakeVisible.Click();
    loginUsernameEntry.Clear();
    loginUsernameEntry.SendKeys(""Username"");
    loginPasswordEntry.Clear();
    loginPasswordEntry.SendKeys(""Password"");
    loginExecuteButton.Click(); //Now logging in
    Browser.WaitForPageReload() //Own code in Browser class see below (1)
}

public void Logout()
{
    loginLogoutElementMakeVisible.Click(); //Never clicked in test
    logoutExecuteButton.Click() //Now logging out
}

In Browser class (1) -&gt;
public void WaitForPageReload()
{
    IWait&lt;IWebDriver&gt; wait = new OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30.00));

    wait.Until(driver1 =&gt; ((IJavaScriptExecutor)driver).ExecuteScript(""return document.readyState"").Equals(""complete""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried creating two separate fieldmember WebElements (e.g. one loginElementMakeVisible and one logoutElementMakeVisible) for the button to display the login and the logout button, but still having them in the same page object and thus initializing them at the same time (Thought this could work since pagefactory uses lazy loading)</p>

<p>I have also tried to have the logout button in another pageobject which is initialized after login in the test.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the pagefactory update its proxy to the loginLogoutElementMakeVisible so I can logout? Or am I still trying to logout before the page after logging has had a chance to load? Are there other problems which could explain why I cannot click the MakeVisible element?</p>

<p>For functional requirements, however, whether the system got better or worse since the previous version is a more subjective issue. A simple comparison of the number of failed test cases across versions may bring misleading results, as this does not account for the importance of the test case nor the impact of the problem on the user experience.

<p>UPDATE: One of the major issues we noticed with using Subversion and the RFT project was that merging changes to the object map by more than one person had problems.

If you've followed some of my <a href=""https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/180/how-to-deal-with-testers-who-do-more-than-test"">other</a> <a href=""https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/149/1-5-million-lines-of-code-0-tests-where-should-we-start"">questions</a> you know essentially, we have no automated tests and our 'testers' are the analysts who design the projects.</p>

<p>When I recently brought up the idea of a more formal (I actually used the term 'industry standard') QA department, I was told ""The decision was made to go to a lean development process."" Turns out that decision was made about 7 or 8 years ago. Only in the last 5 months have I convinced them to move to a 2 week deploy cycle (it was 3-4 months before) and only in the last month are they cutting a 'build' that goes for the 'testers' to test. Also, any changes necessary are made to that 'build' (the code is able to be compiled or interpreted, so modification is easy.) The reason 'build' is in quotes is because it's really just a copy of trunk, with the most recent changes put higher up in the path so they get found first, and it all gets interpreted on the fly.</p>

<p>So, it seems there's a fundamental misunderstanding of what ""lean development"" is. They had a QA department in the past, but were bothered by their lack of productivity. Of course, we know that a QA department isn't 'productive'. If you look at it from a manufacturing point of view (which they do,) QA by definition hinders productivity by increasing the chance of failed and extended-time projects. (We've tried using the argument that QA for software is like QA for the products they manufacture. They don't see it the same way because there's government mandates for their QA, but not for the software.)</p>

Under these definitions, checking is a subset of testing.  </p>

<p>Examples:  Most automated regression tests would be ""checking"".  Manual testing that doesn't go ""off the rails"" would be manual checking, but as soon as a tester leaves a script and starts investigating other behavior, they've started exploratory testing.  Ad-hoc testing would not be checking.  Fuzzing and stability testing would normally not be ""checks"", but automated exploratory tests.</p>

<p>I feel like there are a number of cases where people say, ""Tests should have feature X"", but then there are 10 exceptions to the rule.  However, many of these statements seem to be truer and clearer when stated as ""Checks should have feature X"".  For example, ""Given the same inputs, automated checks should always produce the same outputs unless there is a change to the code.""  However, there are many tests (stability, performance, semi-random input, etc.) that would naturally have some level of variation in their outputs that are useful but do not meet this criteria.  However, I also can see how this distinction could seem overly pedantic.  </p>

<p>Concluding question, or,
TL;DR: Is the idea of ""checking"" as a subset of testing a useful one?</p>

<p>P.S. Edits to link articles / sources for this concept will be appreciated, if anyone here knows what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>P.P.S.  What I'm trying to get at is, 'Is a distinction between ""testing"" vs. ""checking"" like this useful', not 'Is it used?'  I know it's not a commonly used concept, but it is a concept that people have been trying to introduce. Does the concept of ""checking"" to describe a subset of ""testing"" help with communication about tests and testing?  Would it be a good thing to introduce it to tester / QA vocabulary?</p>

<li>It is used by a significant portion of a sites users, and is in common, widespread usage.</li>
<li>It is the default browser on the latest version of Windows or Mac OS X.</li>
<li>It is a newly released, or about to be released browser which is expected to quickly gain a significant portion of browser market share, e.g. the current in beta version of IE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this the best technique available or is there something better?</p>

The project involves several layers of HW and software and requires mainly black box testing but also some level of grey box testing (getting readings from within the code, but without actually reading or modifying the code).
The goal of this document is to assess the feasibility of the project from testing point of view- required test equipment, time, personnel, needed automation etc. 
The approach I am going to use is to start by using a table with test types on one side (Functional, Performance, Stability) and modules/sub modules on the other side (GUI, computation engine, API from A to B etc.) then fill each square with high level headline for tests. When done, the table gives a pretty good idea of the project.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts were to create a payload class which would contain the XML elements for my test(an example is below)</p>

<pre><code>public class CreateOrderPayload
{
    public static string OrderPayload()
    {
        XDocument OrderData = new XDocument();
        XElement root = new XElement(""Order"");
        DateTime now = DateTime.Now;

        root.Add(new XElement(""BillingAddress"",
            new XElement(""AddressLine1"", ""Canada adress 17""),
            new XElement(""AddressLine2"", ""ccc""),
        root.Add(new XElement(""Customer"",
            new XElement(""ContactNumber"", ""ContactNum""),
            new XElement(""EmailAddress"", ""andy@test.com""),
        root.Add(new XElement(""OriginalOrderId"", ""2315923148""));
        root.Add(new XElement(""Source"", ""fffff""));

        OrderData.Add(root);

        return OrderData.ToString();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my actual test I'd then look to call the above class so that I can grab the payload to use for my test. I'm using RestSharp to do this so would initialise my test with something like the below:</p>

<pre><code>        restClient = new RestClient(Constants.CRCOrderApi);
        restRequest = new RestRequest(Method.POST);

<p>To happy-path test this function, I would need to create a real file, maybe somehow track its absolute pathname, and delete the file afterwards.

<p><strong>Is it ever acceptable, in a unit-test, to create a real file for testing?</strong>
If not, is this even fully testable?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> : I overlooked the fact that I could just pass in the name of the very file the tests, or even this part of the SUT, is written in! </p>

<p>We have a mission critical AngularJS application which we extensively test with e2e tests using Protractor/WebdriverJS. At the current state, we have ~30000 lines of existing e2e tests which are executed daily multiple times either fully or partially for multiple different reasons (e.g. daily or smoke tests).</p>
<p><em>The application itself is in the beginning stages of &quot;migrating&quot; to ReactJS</em> and the biggest question our QA department is facing is whether we can keep the existing set of e2e tests. As you probably inferred from the size of the test code, we've been investing in e2e tests a lot.</p>
<p>We've been following Page Object pattern and try to keep the page definitions separated from the logic of the tests.</p>
<p>One of the issues that will arise if we try to adopt Protractor test codebase to work against a React-based app is that Protractor would not be able to &quot;sync&quot; with Angular on every selenium command breaking the current natural flow of the e2e tests - I would imagine we would need to put explicit and implicit waits all over the codebase to make sure desired pre-conditions are met before any actions are applied.</p>
<h3>The Question</h3>
<p>What are the pros and cons of adjusting the existing test codebase to work with a ReactJS based application vs starting with e2e tests from scratch with, probably, a better &quot;React-friendly&quot; test framework? What things we should consider to make this decision?</p>

<p>Well, I think it is only true if the cost for defects found by customer is higher. What I mean is:</p>

<p>when I invest in the testing, the cost of rework of defects it discovers will be more or less the same as if the customer discovered it. My developers are paid the same, no matter whether they fix a bug found by the customer or ourselves. Of course, there will be some overhead included and I do not take into account indirect costs like our reputation going down for producing buggy software.</p>

<p>But I just do not believe the failure costs decrease as appraisal costs increase, as several books state.<br>
Take the following situations:</p>

<p><strong>More testing, less customer defects</strong>
Cost of testing: 10K (several issuses found)<br>
Rework cost of internally found defects: 5K<br>
Rework cost of externally found defects 3K<br>
Total=18K.</p>

<p><strong>Less testing, more customer defects</strong><br>
Cost of testing: 2K (not many issues found)<br>
Rework of issues (few ours + all from customer): 12K. (more twice as much as in the previous situation)<br>
Total=14K</p>

Each step has some transition before the next steps are visible, so I am using driver.wait to make sure I can click or add text etc.</p>

<p>The problem comes when a step has input fields and a next button like 'Address and Zipcode', I've been unable to get the input fields filled out before the button gets clicked, so sometimes it tries clicking the next button before the fields are finished.</p>

<p>I've tried adding driver.sleep around each step to try and solve this but it still wants to click before the fields are done.</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Can anyone help me to solve above <code>TestNG</code> exception?</p>

<p>ANSWER : I saw that this message was closed without answer. I had same issue and spent hours trying all available online solutions. Finally, I figured out myself that I had placed TestRunner (Driver script) in main package instead of test package of maven project. Once I moved it to test package, it worked like a charm ! Hope this helps to others. </p>

<p>So I have a simple test case - ""<em>Login with incorrect username and password</em>"". </p>

<strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open the browser</li>
<li>Enter the URL “<a href=""http://practice.automationtesting.in/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://practice.automationtesting.in/</a>”</li>
<li>Click on ""My Account""</li>

<li>Enter incorrect password in password textbox.</li>
<li>Click on login button</li>
<li>Proper error must be displayed (i.e. Invalid username) and prompt to
enter login again.</li>
</ol>

<p>My logic is quite simple, if the provided user/pass are incorrect, I must receive an error message, and if I find this element on the page (by it's XPath), then the user/pass are incorrect indeed.</p>

<pre><code>class LoginTest(unittest.TestCase):
    baseURL = ""http://practice.automationtesting.in/""
    username = ""incorrect@email.com""
    password = ""incorrect_password""

<p>I did something wrong? I'm sure there is another way to execute the step nr. 7. Can you give me an example? Thank you.</p>

<p>I've defined a recurring scenario, which creates a task in the System Under Test, that I want to use in many different tests. However, the task names need to be different. I tried to arrange that by including <a href=""http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.QuickReferenceGuide#GlobalVARIABLES"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME}</code></a> in the Slim table.</p>

<pre><code>!2 Task configuration
|scenario        |create new task with duration           |duration                               |
|click           |New                                                                             |
|enter           |[TEST] ${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME} @{duration}s|as|Name                                |
</code></pre>

<p>This sort-of works, except that this produces the following Name: <code>[TEST] &lt;a href=""Example.T002Scripts""&gt;T002Scripts&lt;/a&gt; 20s</code>. I want (and expected) it to be <code>[TEST] T002Scripts 20s</code> or <code>[TEST] Example.T002Scripts 20s</code> (both would be fine). Is there any way to get rid of that HTML markup? I've tried other variables (<code>${PAGE_NAME}</code>, <code>${PAGE_PATH}</code> and <code>${RUNNING_PAGE_PATH}</code>) but to no avail.</p>

<p>Been in the industry for over a year, got the wonderful opportunity to join the team despite no prior background, loving and enjoying every moment so far actually. My only dilemma is that there were no senior QAs to pass down their knowledge to me.</p>

<p>Our teams are divided into frontend and backend, and I am part of the frontend team. As I mention, this is my first ever role, with no senior QAs passing down their knowledge. We have existing projects, but I felt like our automation weren't that great, in a sense that most of them are flaky, and I was fairly new to the role, so I didn't know much about automation strategy apart from the fact that - ""Automation is good! You don't need to test things manually!""</p>

<p>After a while, I realise there is some truth to that, but that doesn't necessarily mean automate everything, which was my thoughts previously, to try to automate as much functionality each sprint.</p>

<p>Now we are starting a new project, and I am, again the sole QA for the frontend team. I would like to know how other teams approach their manual UI regression testing and also how you go about approaching automation</p>

<p><strong>Manual</strong>: We all know that UI is very fragile, and there are lots of part and bits of pieces to it. From my experience, anything and literally ANYTHING could happen. So how do you guys keep track of every single thing?</p>

<p><strong>Automation</strong>: From my learnings, it seems that UI automation are very flaky and should be kept to a minimum due to the always changing nature of the frontend. Since I am solely focusing on frontend, how would you guys decide on what to automate etc?</p>

<p>Any input would be appreciated. Would love to hear how other companies approach their frontend testing</p>

Big and (probably overly) complicated backend + web frontend. There are many business processes implemented in the app. Currently there are 10 teams working on it.</p>

<p><strong>Tests</strong>: there are unit tests and integration tests implemented. Code coverage is at around 70%.
There are also MANY automated system and e2e tests implemented in a commercial test tool.</p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>there are way too many system and e2e tests. They were added over the years as at first there were no other tests being written. Only after a while someone thought of adding Java-based unit and integration tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart of the code coverage of the unit und integration tests the test coverage is a big unknown. The knowledge about which functionality is tested by what system test is kept only in the heads of the testers. There is no real way to know which tests need to be fixed, when a new story is implemented, other than running the regression test suite and to look what broke.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In my opinion we need to get rid of a big chunk of the system tests ASAP, as they are not maintainable any more, flaky and take waaay to long to run (~24h concurrently on 50 VMs). There are dead tests, that test removed functionality, many duplicates etc.</p>

<p>In order to do that first I would like to know the test coverage, to be able to tell which tests are useless and can be deleted safely.</p>

<p><strong>I am looking for a way to determine/estimate the test coverage in such a project</strong> </p>

<p>The obvious way of connecting the test with the corresponding user story/requirement will not work, as for quite many of the implemented functions there are no documented requirements.</p>

<p>The monolith is right now in the process of being refactored into roughly independent modules. The current idea is sorting the system tests based on their belonging to these modules. Additionally the tests belonging to one module can then be sorted based on the business process they test inside that module. With this I should have database of tests broken down by the modules and then by business processes, and thus a <em>rough</em> test coverage estimation by process and module. This still does not convince me, as being the best approach though.</p>

<p>So does this make sense? How else could the test coverage be determined/estimated?</p>

<p>Our test team found itself in a situation where a new feature needs to be tested every two days.</p>

<p>So we have to do function, regression, exploration, and other testing, this loop takes a lot of time because any change or commit in the source code forces it to repeat everything.</p>

<p>They are now waiting for the developer to run his tests in the middle and before the end of the sprint. Is there some kind of best practice for such bottlenecks in the agile environment?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So one should rather solve the problem from the Project Owner side.
Plan fewer tasks in sprint planning? </p></li>
<li><p>Should tasks be rejected in order to avoid this bottleneck?</p></li>
<li><p>Should sprint planning be further punished?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I already described the problem in the retro, the solution was a shortened sprint planning. But, depending on the effort, we still have the problem that we run into this bottleneck over and over again.</p>

<p>But the problem is, we also write and review the test automation. But we simply can't keep up with passing the ""normal"" test, adapting the automatic test at the same time or creating a new one, everything together is simply no longer achievable.</p>

<ul>
<li>So should the execution of the test automation also be included in
the sprint planning?</li>
<li>But wouldn't this even worsen the problem?</li>
<li>Where exactly are the priorities to be defined now? Write and adapt
the test automation, or just normal test, i.e. Explorative,
Functional.</li>
<li>What is important Whitebox or Blackbox test?</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially small teams with few testers and a lot of tasks have these problems in front of them. On the one hand we all know that in the agile world speed is everything, but it is forgotten that the QA is sometimes simply too much burdened. We are only human beings! </p>

<p>Even if the project owner is looking for solutions and everything was reported in the retro, not everything can be solved. Depending on the size of the project, you always have a bottleneck somewhere, and yes it is somehow desperate!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have one Java project in Eclipse that serves as the framework (say FrameworkProject). The project is comprised of these packages, </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>testdata</strong> - holds testdata.java. This returns random test data for my tests like passwords, names etc...</li>
<li><strong>utility</strong> - this package holds the object repository configuration class. This also contains the ExcelConfiguration class.</li>
<li><strong>pageObjects</strong> - this package holds the page object class of the current system under test (e.g Login.class, Register.class etc...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>And the other java project was the TestProject. This only contains one package named tests. Under package tests, it has TestCase.class that serves as the testcase class, executes steps (I'm using page-object model by the way)</p></li>

<p>Now, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it correct that I included the page objects in the first project (in the framework itself) ? Should it be in the TestProject ?</p></li>
<li><p>I did not declare my classes as abstract. What I just did was add the FrameworkProject as a JavaBuildPath to TestProject. Is it correct?</p></li>

<p>My <strong>goal</strong> is to handle all the instantiation code in one place, in my framework code, separated from my tests themselves, and then pass that instance around the framework.</p>

<p>In Ruby, I would do something like this:</p>

<p><strong>./framework/driver.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code>def initialize
  $driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox

  # additional driver configuration
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would include the framework classes in my base test class and call my driver from there.</p>

<p><strong>./tests/utilities/base_test.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code>  def setup
    Driver.new
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I would then have all my tests inherit from BaseTest.</p>

<p>In Java, I am unfamiliar with how to achieve this with access modifiers and package structure.</p>

<p>So far I have something like this (taken from Selenium HQ <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/chrome/ChromeDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>):</p>

<pre><code>  public class Driver {

  private static ChromeDriverService service;
  private WebDriver driver;

  {@literal @BeforeClass}
  public static void createAndStartService() {
    service = new ChromeDriverService.Builder()
        .usingDriverExecutable(new File(""path/to/my/chromedriver.exe""))
        .usingAnyFreePort()
        .build();
    service.start();
  }

  {@literal @AfterClass}
  public static void createAndStopService() {
    service.stop();
  }

  {@literal @Before}
  public void createDriver() {
    driver = new RemoteWebDriver(service.getUrl(),
        DesiredCapabilities.chrome());
  }

  {@literal @After}
  public void quitDriver() {
    driver.quit();
  }

  public WebDriver getDriver() {
   return driver;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, how can I pass this driver instance around my framework (for example, I want my Page objects to be able to use it).  In Ruby, I triggered the creation of a global variable from my BaseTest.  In Java, I've added the getter to return the driver instance.  But this is problematic when I try to introduce TestNG annotations.  For example, I want to create/teardown a driver before/after every test.  I <em>can</em> get it to work, but is this best practice?  Is there a better way?</p>

<p>For example, instead of using TestNG annotations to instantiate my driver, would it be better to use listeners?  I've also heard about Guice and dependency injection -- is this a useful design pattern?</p>

<p>I've seen a number of tutorials, blog posts, articles, etc., on this topic, but I can't find what I'm after.  Again, my main goal here is to handle all my driver instantiation in one place in my framework in such a way that I can pass that same driver instance around.  It shouldn't matter whether it's a local ChromeDriver instance or a Remote WebDriver instance running on a grid.  I need it to be clean and scalable.</p>

[[ -z $build ]] &amp;&amp; { echo ""missing argument: build""; exit 1; }

cd ./visual || exit 1

# let's remove our token from the filename
shopt -s globstar

If the test case count increases, the code coverage took more time to complete the job. so i had switched into <strong>concurrenlty</strong> to implement the parallel test case execution. Before that, the code coverage results are generated as single html file. But now, i had configure the coverage results into separate folders to improve the performance on test cases.  But now, the coverage results are generated as separate html  report. But i want to combine these separate folder's index.html file into single html report. </p>

<p>so that, i have implemented the parallel execution of my repository using <strong>""concurrently""</strong>. I had configured the gulp  generate the separate code coverage reports for each folder. Each folder has set of <strong>.spec file</strong>  The gulp configuration details is given below,</p>

<p><strong>gulp zero:</strong></p>

<pre><code>coverageReporter: {
        dir: './cireports',
        subdir: ""codecoverage/zero"",
        reporters: [
            { type: 'html', file: ""UnitTestCover.html"" },
        ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>gulp one:</strong></p>

<pre><code>coverageReporter: {
        dir: './cireports',
        subdir: ""codecoverage/one"",
        reporters: [
            { type: 'html', file: ""UnitTestCover.html"" },
        ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>gulp two:</strong></p>

<pre><code>coverageReporter: {
        dir: './cireports',
        subdir: ""codecoverage/two"",
        reporters: [
            { type: 'html', file: ""UnitTestCover.html"" },
        ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>gulp three:</strong></p>

<pre><code>coverageReporter: {
        dir: './cireports',
        subdir: ""codecoverage/three"",
        reporters: [
            { type: 'html', file: ""UnitTestCover.html"" },
        ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If I executed following command through command prompt, </p>

<pre><code>concurrently “gulp zero” “gulp one” “gulp two” “gulp three” 
</code></pre>

<p>Test case was executed parallel and the coverage reports  generated in the specific folder. Each coverage folder has index.html file.  So I need to merge the coverage reports from all folders into single index.html file. </p>

<p>I had tried to merge the coverage reports from following package,  <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat</a>. So that I had installed the “gulp-concat” from following command, </p>

<pre><code>npm install  --save -dev gulp-concat
</code></pre>

<p>After that, I had configure the gulp.js to merge the coverage reports, The gulp-concat configuration is given below,</p>

<p><strong>gulp-concat:</strong></p>

<pre><code>gulp.task('merge', function () {
return gulp.src(['./cireports/codecoverage/zero/index.html', './cireports/codecoverage/one/index.html', './cireports/codecoverage/two/index.html', './cireports/codecoverage/three/index.html'])
  .pipe(concat('index.html'))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
</code></pre>

<p>After test case execution completed, I had executed the “gulp merge” to merge the coverage reports. Expected output was not came. The merged index.html file was generated the series of coverage reports in a single index file</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me whether there is any plan to implement the merging of coverage reports?</p>

We also use oAuth with Identity Server, so we need to initially authenticate, then receive a token back which is passed into all of the requests.</p>

<p>The problem is when we make the initial call to authenticate the user, how do we know that the user exists in the environment that we are running the tests?</p>

<p>2 possible solutions that I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the test script, create the User at the beginning (and possibly delete them again at the end). This would be problematic for us because that part of the API is not public (we don't want external users to be able to create new users)</li>
<li>Deploy a dummy identity service that will return an authenticated token. This doesn't feel like it would be a proper integration test for me.</li>

A tester writes a test case in a spreadsheet, with each test step and expected result. Then, another tester reviews the test case and approves it if its ok. The test writer then executes the test when needed.</p>

<p>The problem with the above approach is that sometimes, the test reviewers approve tests even when the test steps are missing some crucial information. This omission was discovered only when a third person was asked to execute some tests. </p>

<p>So, I was thinking of changing the process by making the reviewer execute the test. I believe that this might make the reviewer be more thorough because he has to execute the test, i.e. he cannot afford to miss important details. As an aside, the new way might bring out lack of documentation. When, reviewers find that system documentation is needed in order to run a test, then they will ask for it and mention it to our QA manager (during scrum meetings).</p>

I have a test where I need to check if a spinner is not visible to the user. This is the first test of a series of tests, and until the spinner is not visible, the page elements are not displayed to the user.</p>
<p>I have been trying to implement a wait in order to wait for the element to be invisible , but my tests seem to fail and the tests exit with a success code, however I can still see the spinner being available on the page.</p>
<p>I have even tried the dirty <code>browser.sleep()</code> method, but my tests doesn't even wait for the sleep duration that I have given.</p>
<p>I have this given block of HTML</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class =&quot;loadingContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;always-loader&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&quot;first-time-loader&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div class =&quot;text&gt; Preparing the App just for you&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;img src =&quot;images/d92f6c4a.horizontal_loader.gif&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My test checks that <code>img</code> is not present in the DOM or is not displayed. I have a function that waits for this purpose</p>
<h2>Try 1</h2>
<pre><code>  public waitForSpinnerDisappear(){
  browser.sleep(100000);
    let EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions; 
    const condition = until.elementIsNotVisible($('[src=&quot;images/d92f6c4a.horizontal_loader.gif&quot;]'));
    return browser.wait(condition,500000);

 }
</code></pre>
<h2>Try2</h2>
<pre><code>  let EC = protractor.ExpectedConditions;
</code></pre>
<p><code>browser.wait(EC.invisibilityOf($('[src=&quot;images/d92f6c4a.horizontal_loader.gif&quot;]')),500000);</code></p>
<h2>Try3</h2>
<pre><code>public waitForSpinnerDisappear(){
browser.wait(function(){
  return $('[src=&quot;images/d92f6c4a.horizontal_loader.gif&quot;]').isDisplayed()
  .then(function(result){
    return !result;
  });
  },500000);

 }
</code></pre>
<p>All these conditions doesn't wait for the spinner to disappear from the page and my tests exit with a success code</p>

<p>I can't provide the URL for the application since it's an internal application but I can give the gist for the code in case it's needed. My question here is what do I need to do more in order for the web page to load for the spinner to be loaded.</p>

<p>These fall into a list of tests that are performed on every web site for basic security compliance, a short list here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Form Fields: Visible and Hidden  

<ul>
<li>Escape codes  </li>
<li>SQL Injections  </li>
<li>Non-ascii, Unicode vs UTF-8  </li>

<li>Query String Manipulations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em>etc.</em></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Since these tests are commonly repeated and fairly generic, has anyone compiled a list of Tests created with Selenium that target these well known security compliance related issues?</p>

<p>Some granular extensions based on common security compliance checks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>public static class WebDriverComplianceExtensions
{
    public static void InputOneSixty(this IWebDriver driver, By by)
    {
        var input = driver.WaitUntil(d =&gt; d.FindElement(by));
        input.SendKeys(""&amp;#160;"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And hopefully some sort of intelligent extensions like:</p>

<pre><code>IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
// some page navigation...
Assert.IsTrue(driver.PerformComplianceCheck(By.Id(""FirstNameInputBox"")));

I used to use IntelliJ's IDEA IDE for automation testing. I could actively do live search and on the fly testing of ideas using IDEA's Evaluate Expression functionality.  I could actively look for elements on a page (searching using CSS selectors for instance) and do a click (or see what the text is), and if my test was in debug mode it would do the click on the page. </p>

<p>I was really hoping for a similar experience with WebStorm since it's IntelliJ's answer for Javascript development. I'm in the middle of debugging a Protractor UI test and I can't look at the result of a getText() without doing a <code>.then()</code> clause and a console.log in the <code>.then()</code> clause.  I feel like if I do <code>element.getText()</code> in the Evaluate Expression tool I should be able to see what that Promise will evaluate to without having to do a then clause that resolves the Promise. I understand there's stuff having to do with the asynchronous nature of Javascript that requires the resolution of the Promise, but I would think this super smart IDE would have resolution stuff built in. Is there a way to setup WebStorm to say 'hey, resolve this for me and let me see what happens!""? I would hope for getting the same behavior when I evaluate <code>element.click()</code>.</p>

<p>So I may be at a point that automating this page will not be possible. I am trying to click a popup menu that appears upon clicking an image (arrow). The problem is once I click the arrow, the popup menu does not exist anywhere that I can find. I cannot inspect its element either. It crashes the ""inspect element"" in IE (page must load in IE) and a using a third party extension DebugBar also does nothing.</p>

<p>Whats happening is that in some cases when I select the popup link it opens in a new frame on the same page. The javascript changes everything for the new frame. When it instead uses a new URL (pop up window) I won't have problems navigating. Only when I need the new frame to appear so that I can get the new elments on the page.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9CTV.png"" alt=""A brief picture of the menu.""></p>

<p>I am wondering if anyone have any ideas I could try. </p>

<p>To click the arrow I have to navigate the DOM using an Xpath as the id does not exist. (the ""import"" icon is a button separate from the arrow) Maybe there is something I can do with calling javascript in the source?</p>

<p>I know the target in many places is the UCF_Mainframe. Just most of the changes happen in the javascript (which I can view all the functions by viewing source). What I believe is happening is the popup is all javascript rendered so its probably just an onclick event.</p>

<p>The main body:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TD id=import title=""Import"" class=clsHeaderItem selectedImg=""x"" unselectedImg=""null"" targetArgument="""" target=""UCF_X"" url="""" dataFrame=""null"" popUp=""0""&gt;

&lt;TABLE style=""TABLE-LAYOUT: fixed"" cellSpacing=0 width=""100%"" cellpading=""0""&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=""BorderTop BorderBottom BorderLeft"" height=55 width=""100%"" align=center&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN id=0&gt;Import&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center valign=""middle""&gt;
&lt;DIV style=""PADDING-BOTTOM: 2px; PADDING-TOP: 2px""&gt;&lt;IMG id=0 src=""x""&gt;&lt;IMG id=0 src=""xx""&gt;

&lt;IMG id=1 src=""x3""&gt; &lt;---Arrow Element Here

&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I saw with creating a action builder was that it doesn't behave exactly like a mouse cursor so when you hover over the area it doesn't see it because there are no elements being hovered over it. Though I have not tried this extensively yet. Maybe I could try manually changing the mouse cursor location and than ""click"" but this is probably an ugly way to do things so I will wait to try it.</p>

<p>If all this fails I will have to end up going directly to the DB which I don't want to do. </p>

We have a development team and a full QA team, which does customer focused testing for our product. We want to introduce a middle test team which is more of an extension of the engineering orr, a system integration test team if you will.</p>

<p>Thinking about the rules for what the developers are expected to test, what this new team is expected to test, and the final QA customer team. The problem it is supposed to solve is the QA team gets code which is not really tested well, and falls apart right away, since developers are doing unit tests mostly, and QA is doing scale, customer focused scenarios. We are doing smoke to take care of the immediate fall apart, but want to do some more, take a bit of load off the devs, but not all the way.</p>

<p>The project is in python and its a bunch of different modules that interact with each other.</p>

<p>Developers today do only unit tests, class level, and some very very limited ""system"" level tests. </p>

<p>I was interested in finding out what other folks do for a mix like this. I want the developers to do more ""System"" level testing, something where they test their components end to end in the system perspective also, at some scale larger than one operation or two concurrent operations. But I am coming up against the question of what is expected out of this new team in that case. The only things I can think of are scale and a full all-components-together testing, but thats something the QA team will do in any case.</p>
